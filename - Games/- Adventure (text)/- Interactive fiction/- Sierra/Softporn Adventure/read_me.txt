Softporn Adventure is a comedic, adult-oriented text adventure game
produced for the Apple II in 1981. The game was created by Charles
Benton and released by On-Line Systems, later renamed Sierra On-Line.

Softporn Adventure inspired the Leisure Suit Larry series of
adult-oriented videogames, and the first entry in that series was a
nearly direct graphical adaptation of Softporn Adventure.

The game's box cover and advertisement features three nude women and a
male waiter in a hot tub, shot at Ken and Roberta Williams's home. From
left to right in the hot tub are Diane Siegel, On-Line's production
manager; Susan Davis, On-Line's bookkeeper and the wife of Bob Davis,
the creator of Ulysses and the Golden Fleece; Rick Chipman, an actual
waiter from a local restaurant, The Broken Bit; and Roberta Williams,
founder of Sierra On-Line.

Softporn Adventure was considered scandalous at the time, and the
company received hate mail. The positive and negative publicity helped
sell an estimated 50,000 copies, an unusually large number especially at
a time when Apple had only sold a couple hundred thousand Apple II
microcomputers. Because computer stores did not want to order only one
game from On-Line they purchased other software with it; Williams
estimated that Softporn temporarily doubled On-Line's sales.
