These Infocom samplers were distributed during the company's heyday, to
give customers a taste of what the games were like without having to
spend big bucks on a full game.  Of course, if the customer liked what he
saw, he'd go on to buy a game or two.

SAMPLER 1 contains:
Interactive Fiction Tutorial
Excerpt from "Zork I"

SAMPLER 2 contains:

Although not really playable as games, these Infocom Samplers are
interesting tidbits.
