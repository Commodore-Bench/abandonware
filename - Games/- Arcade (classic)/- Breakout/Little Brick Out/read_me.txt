The Atari game Breakout was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve
Bristow, influenced by the seminal 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and
built by Steve Wozniak (aided by Steve Jobs).

Little Brick Out is Steve Wozniak's software version of Breakout, which 
directly influenced his design for the Apple II computer. A lot of
features of the Apple II went in because of how Wozniak had designed
Breakout for Atari.
