"Adventure Construction Kit" was written by Stuart Smith, author of "Ali
Baba" and "Return to Heracles". Not surprisingly, a lot of the games you
can make look like these two.

Originally distributed separately, "Ali Baba" and "Return to Heracles"
were later distributed together as "Age of Adventure".
