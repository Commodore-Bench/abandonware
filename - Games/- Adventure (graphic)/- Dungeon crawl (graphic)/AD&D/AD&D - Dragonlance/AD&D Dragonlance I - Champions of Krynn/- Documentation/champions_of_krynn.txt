Champion of Krynn Mini-Docs

This game Requires a 64k or larger Apple II with a 65CO2 processor.
In most cases, this will exclude Apple II models prior to the
enhanced //e.

As of September 2000, this game will not run correctly on AppleWin.
You can not reliably Save and Restore games or characters.

The game runs fine on Apple Oasis.


This package includes .dsk disk emulator files for the Krynn Boot Disk,
Game Disks A-F, and a Save Disk. All of these, except the Save Disk, are
write-protected.

The Save Disk includes a couple of pre-made characters and a saved
game used for checking the Save Disk. You can ignore these and start
as though the disk is a blank Save Disk-- that is, you can start by
creating six new characters and beginning the adventure. When you
first save a game it will overwrite the old saved game.

The game normally includes documentation protection: At various key
points you are asked to type in a word from the Adventurer's Journal.
This protection has been removed (ref. Dr Crack in Computist #77).
When the documentation check asks you to type in a word, you can just
press RETURN.

GETTING STARTED

Format two blank disks as save game disks. While 
playing the game you should alternate saving the game 
first to one disk and then to the other. This way
you will always have two backup positions in case your
characters get into a particularly nasty situation.
Whenever the computer prompts you to change disks,
place the correct disk in the drive and press the joystick
button or RETURN .

To Start The Game: Connect your computer and
monitor. If you use a joystick, make sure it is properly
connected. If you have a Hard Disk, turn it off. IIgs users
should use the control panel to set startup slot to 6. Turn
on the monitor. Insert the Boot Disk into Disk Drive 1 and
then turn on the computer .

The first screen will give you a number of options: Play
with Sound, Joystick Installed, Fast Computer CPU, Copy
Krynn Game Disk, and Play The Champions of Krynn.
These will appear each time you boot the game.

To change an option, use the up or down arrow keys to
highlight that option and press the Return key. EXAMPLE:
The default option for sound is Yes (sound on). To turn the
sound off, highlight this option and press the Return key.
If your computer has an accelerator card or if you are
playing on a IIgs at fast speed, you should set the Fast

Computer CPU to Yes. You will need to change the joystick .
option to Yes if you are playing with a joystick.
The first time you boot the game, you should use the Copy
Krynn Game Disk option to make copies of the disks we
give you. To start the game. highlight the Play
Krynn...option and press Return (Note: You will not be able
to give commands with your joystick until after you have
left the first screen).

To Use a Joystick: If you are using a joystick, you will
have to initialize it at the start of each game. This
initialization process tells the program how to read your
joystick correctly. To initialize the joystick, you should
place it as directed (center, left center, right center, top
center, and bottom center) and press Return when the
joystick is in the desired position. When this is done,
center the joystick again and press return one more time
to start the game.

To Begin Playing Quickly: A ready-to-go party of
adventurers is saved on Disk 1, Side A. To load this party
select LOAD SA VED GAME from the Party Creation menu and
insert Side A when the saved game is requested.
The characters start at the very beginning of the game
already outfitted with equipment and memorized spells.
The exception to this is the kender character, who will
have to ready his hoopak from combat or while encamped.
When using this party. you may exit the outpost as soon as
Sir Karl is through speaking.

Refer to the sections on movement, combat, etc. in this data
card, or from the rule book or journal as needed.
Using Menus: Most options in the game are selected
from horizontal and vertical menus. Horizontal menus
select action, such as casting spells, or readying weapons.
Vertical menus generally select items to be acted upon,
such as spells to be cast or weapons to be readied.
To access menus with the keyboard, use the up & down
cursor controls for vertical menus and the left & right
controls for hor!zontal. Press ENTER to make selections.

The joystick is similar to the keyboard; use the button to
make selections.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

Apple Specific: The following items are Apple only, and
are not in the Manual or Adventurer's Journal:

The <ESC> key is the same as the EXIT command from
menus. In combat, pressing this key will "take back" a
move. This will not erase any damage taken during the
move.

Some items, such as hoopaks, can only be readied during
combat or while encamped. If you attempt to ready such
an item in the wrong place, you will get a NOT HERE
message.

Q: Will set the entire party to AUTO (computer control for
combat). <SPACE>: will return the party to your control
from AUTO.

M: Toggles magic on/off for characters under AUTO
control.

During combat enemy names will be displayed in inverse
letters. The names appear on the right side of the screen
whenever the cursor is over a character in your line of
sight (one that one of your player characters can see).
Hint: If you find combat to be either too easy or too
difficult, use the Level command --rule book, page 7.

Note: This game requires that your computer have a 65CO2
processor.
