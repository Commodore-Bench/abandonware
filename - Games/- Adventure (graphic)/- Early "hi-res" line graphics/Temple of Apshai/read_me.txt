Temple of Apshai is considered one of the first graphical role-playing
games for home computers, predating even the commercial release of
Richard Garriott's Akalabeth: World of Doom. It was an enormous success
for its era, selling 20,000 copies by the end of 1981, and 30,000 copies
by 30 June 1982 and remaining a best-seller for at least four years.
