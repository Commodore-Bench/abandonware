Queen of Phobos is a little known and very early graphical
science-fiction adventure game that saw very limited distribution.

This game would have been a good seller, but right at time of its
release Ken and Roberta Williams of Sierra On-Line, publisher of Mystery
House and later Wizard and the Princess, started to suing a bunch of
little software companies out of existence. Queen of Phobos became one
of those victims, for using the phrase "Hi-Res" adventure on the
packaging.
