Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord was developed by Andrew
Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed Sir-Tech
Software, Inc. and launched a Beta version of the product at the 1980
Boston Computer Convention. The final version of the game was released
in 1981.

The game was one of the first Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing
games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer
color graphics. It was also the first true party-based role-playing
video game.
