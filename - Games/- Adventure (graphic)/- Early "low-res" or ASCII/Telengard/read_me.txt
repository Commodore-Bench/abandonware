Telengard was originally DND, a 1976 version of Dungeons & Dragons for the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer. It was rewritten for the Commodore PET 2001 after 1978, and then ported to Apple II+, TRS-80, and Atari 800 platforms before Avalon Hill found the game at a convention and licensed it for distribution. Its Commodore 64 release was the most popular. 

RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and Gamasutra's Barton considered Telengard consequential in what he deemed "The Silver Age" of computer role-playing games preceding the golden age of the late 1980s. 

Although many quote DND as one of the original dungeon crawls, Rogue, Moria, Oubliette, Hack, and various other mainframe incarnations existed as well, all with very similar play.
