Welcome to Titan!

<p>
Paramount Mining, Inc., welcomes you and your family to Titan.
This guide will help you as a new employee in our company or
as a visitor to adapt quickly and comfortably to your new
home and become a member of our little "family."
<p>
Titan, one of the far outposts of civilization in the solar
system, is still an untamed world of wonder. Windswept crimson
deserts, with sand composed of hydrocarbons, dominate the landscape.
Through the beautiful red haze of the atmosphere, you can glimpse
the sun surrounded by a halo of methane ice crystals. Titan is
almost terrifying in its primordial beauty.
<p>
Yet, under the guidance of Paramount Mining, Inc., this "last
frontier" is finally being tamed. The fierce native wildlife that
once threatened our settlements is confined almost completely to
the surface, while the subsurface and its vast riches are now the
domain of man. Titan, with its vast cities and forward-looking
social plans, has been and will continue to be a model of efficient,
effective space colonization.
<p>
As the human race continues to expand ever onward toward new frontiers
in other solar systems, Titan will remain Sol's last stepping stone
to the stars. And Paramount Mining, Inc., will remain in the vanguard
of interstellar exploration, making life on new planets as safe -- and
productive -- as it is on Titan.
<p>
<i>give me a break! pmi screwed up titan and no they'll screw up other
planets too!</i>

<p>
<h2>A Brief History of Titan</h2>
The Voyager probes that flew by Titan in the late 20th century revealed
a satellite just waiting to be explored. Clouded in a think reddish-orange
shroud and showing abundant hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, Titan seemed
the one place in the solar system besides Earth that might support life.
The first NASA landing on Titan in 2042 revealed, tragically, that life
did indeed exist beyond Earth. The first reports of proto-amoeboid life-forms
were greeted joyfully by scientists everywhere, and as other species were
discovered in abundance, it soon became evident that Titan supported life 
in almost as much diversity as old Earth. Unfortunately, the first astronauts
were unprepared for the very large creatures roaming the Titanian ice plains 
-- predators that made little distinction between burrowing animals and 
investigating scientists. O'Neill Spaceport is named in honor of the brave
leader of the NASA expedition who gave his life in the cause of exploration.
<p>
The loss of that expedition almost led to the collapse of NASA. Fortunately,
however, Paramount Mining, Inc., stepped forward and agreed to help underwrite
the space agency. Under the aegis of Paramount Mining, NASA was revitalized,
and the exploration and colonization of the solar system has continued unabated.
<p>
Titan -- and, indeed, the rest of the solar system -- might never have been
settled except for the first NASA expedition's discovery of SOL-R-GARD, a
compressed hydrocarbon unique to this satellite. This unique material absorbs
the intense radiation of solar flares and re-emits is as plain light. Despite
the costs and dangers involved, Paramount Mining committed itself to developing
this resource and established its first base on Titan. Since SOL-R-GARD is 
concentrated in large veins deep under the surface, it has been only natural
to exploit the vast subterranean tunnel system occuring throughout the moon.
Not only do the tunnels allow miners easier access to the SOL-R-GARD deposits,
they also keep the inhabitants safe from the native Titanian predators that
dominate the surface.
<p>
<i>try telling that to the scorads!</i>
<p>
The first base on Titan, Primus, was established in 2089 and quickly became
the focal point for Paramount Mining's new social experiment. With its initial 
95% male population, Primus was a rather rough place to live. However, Paramount
Mining, as an equal opportunity employer, strongly encouraged families to emigrate
to Titan. Further, with additional manpower still in demand, the Company has 
recently begun working with correctional facilities throughout the solar system;
men and women with criminal records are welcomed to start over again, their pasts
wiped clean the moment they land on Titan and sign up with Paramount Mining. The
resulting mixture of rugged individualists, strong family units, and reconstructed
souls has created a unique society, well adapted to life at the farthest reaches
of human settlement.
<p>

<p>
<h2>The Controller Is Your Friend</h2>
There are no local governments <i>per se</i> on Titan. Instead, each city is
under the jurisdiction of a Paramount Mining Controller, who is responsible
both for local mining operations and for the health and welfare of the
civilian population. The Office of the Controller serves many functions on
Titan: labor mediation, judiciary, human resources, mine supervision,
administration, and finances. Whatever your problems or complaints, go to
your local Controller's office for quick and satisfactory resolutions.
<p>
<i>if you can ever get into see the jerk!</i>

<p>
<h2>The Police Are Your Friends</h2>
The Police Department is a division of the Office of the Controller
and is responsible for the safety of civilian population. There are
several police stations in every city, strategically placed so that
officers can reach the scene of any emergency in just a few minutes.
<p>
Titan is currently undergoing a transition in security forces. Originally,
when the first bases were established on the statellite, military forces
were needed to protect the population form the Titanian predators. Now that
the cities are completely underground and well protected from surface creatures,
the military is being phased out in favor of the civilian police force.
We ask your patience during this period of transition.
<p>
Although disrespect for the law was once common among early
settlers, attitudes have changed tremendously in recent years.
However, because certain individuals -- especially Nomads --
persist in taking the law into their own hands, the Police
Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Controller,
has set up a bounty system to help identify and apprehend known
criminals. Information about this system may be obtained at your
local police station.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT WARNING:</b> Golum armor is reserved specifically for
the elite police force. It is a felony for any citizen without the
proper training and authorization to possess Golum armor. Remember,
each suit of Golum armor is molded specifically for the user and is
therefore useless to anyone else.

<p>
<h2>Setting Up House</h2>
If this is your first visit to Titan, you may wish to visit all
four cities. Until the speeder extension to Proscenium is 
completed, however, travel to that city is extremely limited.
It should be noted that all cities on Titan are built in former
mining shafts, and therefore their layouts may seem odd.

<p>
<h2>Primus</h2>
This is the first city contructed on Primus and is
the pride and joy of Paramount Mininge, Inc. Despite heavey criticism
from Earth's leaders as to the dangers of indigenous life-forms, the
company proved that a city could not only be built on Titan buy could
also be made almost 100% secure. This city in particular retains much 
of the pioneer spirit of its original settlers.
<p>
<i>secure from critters but not from human predators!</i>

<p>
<h2>Progeny</h2>
Established after Primus, Progeny now has the highest population
rate of the three completed cities. Its large police force and
better-organized layout make this city the safest on Titan.
<p>
<i>safe is a relative term!</i>

<p>
<h2>Parallax</h2>
Here the spirit of the "Old West" is still very much alive. The
newest of the completed Titanian cities, Parallax, is still 
expanding. As it is the current "frontier" of Titan. there is 
a certain danger in living here. Paramount Mining is beefing
up the police and military forces in this area to make it
secure for families.
<p>
<i>nomads purchase illegal food and arms here!</i>

<p>
<h2>Proscenium</h2>
Already planned to be the largest city on Titan,
Proscenium is still in the "outpost" stage. The
extensive SOL-R-GARD veins in the area have created
the largest mining operation on Titan, and as veins
are exhausted, the city of proscenium expands. Once
completed, Proscenium will be a multi-level wonder,
unlike the other Titanian cities which are all one leve.
Paramount Mining employees who agree to work in the 
Proscenium mines will be rewarded with the largest
apartments.
<p>
<i>working proscenium is suicide!</i>
