Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn

This is a cracked and working version of Wizardry III, but you must
cover the write protect notch for the (master) scenario side of Wizardry
III before playing!

Note: 1) the Scenario Master Disk must be locked with a write protect
tag. 2) You must create a blank Scenario Disk to play. 3) You must
transfer characters created in "Wizardry I - Proving Grounds" to your
Scenario Disk to start playing, as outlined in the Legacy of Llylgamyn
manual in the "Ritual Preparation" and "The Rite of Passage Ceremony"
sections.
