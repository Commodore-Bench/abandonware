Apventure to Atlantis is the sequel to Odyssey, its story picks up with
the player as ruler of the island, and updates the format of the game to
include internal areas displayed in the form of the then-current
"Mystery House" game by Roberta Williams, and also incorporating a parser
that allowed the use of text adventure-style commands.
