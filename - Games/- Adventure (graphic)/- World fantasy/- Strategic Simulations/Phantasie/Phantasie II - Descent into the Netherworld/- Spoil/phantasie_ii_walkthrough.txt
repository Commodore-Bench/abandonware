  INTRODUCTION AND QUIRKS

    I actually like the Apple's interface and gameplay a bit better much 
as the Commodore, but as the Apple conks out with the current disk 
images on Asimov, it's a good bet to go with the Commodore.  You can 
work through the dungeons on that.  The graphics are a bit simpler on 
the Apple, and you can see the whole dungeon at once, but the Commodore 
has superior monster drawings and uses color-coding pretty effectively.  
It also allows you to set combat options which are, confusingly, reset 
when you go back inside or outside.  The Commodore also doesn't allow 
you to type in player numbers directly, which is maddening for a quick 
typer like me.

    ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT AND HOW IT WAS WRITTEN

    This document will not attempt to explain basic rules.  You can find 
manuals at project64.c64.org, www.theunderdogs.org, and likely many 
other places I don't know about.  I am largely concerned with details, 
i.e. if you do X, Y happens, or the best/most convenient way to solve 
puzzle Z is to do W.
    Sadly there was no PC version of Phantasie, so I had to make do with 
the Apple for data extraction.  I mentioned the, err, quirk above and 
every effort has been made to ensure that traces of it are ironed out in 
this FAQ.
    The text map is actually originally derived from the Apple, where it 
is easier and more logical to extract sectors than the Commodore.  Yes, 
the rotations made things a bit tough, but with appropriate fudging of 
variables(they'd send my HS computer-science teacher into a tizzy.  Oh 
well!) I changed the Apple maps to look like Commodore ones.  The 
dungeon maps are for the Apple but when I ran through the game they 
equated over 99.99% with the Commodore.
    This document tries to explore the details of the game, so it may be 
light on overall improving your characters.  A brief run-through showed 
that the Phantasie series is really rather moderate, and it is 
relatively easy to improve without getting squashed.

  ITEM MANIFEST

The items below are treasures.  Your best bet to find them is to kill

need the cash, but it's always fun to pick up more doohickeys.

There are a few differences between Phantasie and Phantasie II.  First 
of all there are the scrolls--some blank.  That is because some scrolls 
take more than one page to explain things.  If you put an invalid item 
in the scroll will just start in the middle.  Then you have eight 
amulets and a wand instead of the nine rings.  The orb replaces the 
wand, and at 165 a painting replaces an orb as treasure to avoid 
confusion.  Then 177-179 are also changed, from BOX to BOOK, GOLDEN to 
SILVER, and FOX to FORK.

  MONSTER MANIFEST

  This information was taken directly from the disk info so it should be 
good although I have my suspicion about the skeleton.  There are also a 
lot of variables I couldn't figure out so if anyone thinks they can help 
drop me a line at schultza@earthlink.net and I can send you the data.  I 
think I have the very biggest stuff here though.

There aren't many differences between the Commodore and Apple version in 
terms of monster attributes.  However, the Commodore has a 21 character 
limit(see the giant constrictor) and Pluto's compound beasts are not 
hyphenated(Demon Fly, Snake Dragon, Dragon Demon.)  Also the Beeping 
Blobs don't beep :).

Interestingly WYWERN is spelled incorrectly even though there are two 
WYVERNS on the scroll about his beasts.

I'm also not sure how to fight Pluto's Ice Dragon as all the 
conversations seem to end up with it brushing your challenges off.

  SCROLLS

    These scrolls contain some serious spoilers, but they also help 
round the story out.  You can pretty much learn everything you need to 
do in the game from them, so proceed carefully reading them.

    Note that these scrolls are also for the Apple.  I have placed 
modifiers for the Commodore underneath as with the world rotated the 
directions in the scrolls need to be changed as well.

     SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE EVIL WIZ-  *
 ARD NIKADEMUS TOOK HIS TERRIBLE ARMY *
 OF MEN AND BEASTS THROUGH THE SOUTH- *
 ERN ISLANDS OF THE LAND INCLUDING    *
 GELNOR, FERRONRAH, AND THE LESSER    *
 ISLANDS.  IN A MATTER OF MONTHS      *
 HE HAD COMPLETELY OVERTAKEN THE      *
 CAPITAL.  NIKADEMUS ALSO HAD THE     *
 KING AND QUEEN AND THE REST OF THE   *
 ROYAL FAMILY EXECUTED.               *
     IN FERRONRAH HE COMPLETELY OBLIT-*
 ERATED THE CAPITAL CITY LEAVING NOT  *
 A SINGLE BUILDING STANDING. THE CAP- *
 ITAL HAS SINCE BEEN MOVED TO FERRON, *
 A SMALL CITY TO THE NORTH OF THE OLD *
 ISLANDS.                             *
     BEFORE HE LEFT FERRONRAH, NIK-   *
 ADEMUS DECIDED TO MAKE SURE THAT     *
 NO ARMY WILL BE SENT AFTER HIM FROM  *
 FERRONRAH.                           *
 HE CAST A TERRIBLE CURSE UPON THE    *
 ISLAND WHICH CAUSES ALL MORTALS      *
 ENTERING OR LEAVING FERRONRAH TO BE  *
 GREATLY REDUCED IN MENTAL AND        *
 PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES.               *
     THUS ANY NORMAL MAN SAILING TO   *
 OR FROM THE ISLAND IS RENDERED CLOSE *
 TO THE POINT OF DEATH.  EVEN THE     *
 GREATEST OF WARRIORS WILL BECOME     *
 ORDINARY MEN.  NIKADEMUS THEREFORE   *
 CAN COLLECT TAXES FROM THE DENIZENS  *
 OF THE ISLAND AND FEEL SAFE THAT     *
 NONE OF THE DENIZENS OF THE ISLAND   *
 WOULD EVER TAKE VENGENCE ON HIM.     *
     NIKADEMUS CAST THE TERRIBLE      *
 CURSE WITH THE AID OF THE EVIL GOD   *
 PLUTO.  THE CURSE WAS PLACED IN      *
 AN ANCIENT ORB MADE OF VERY STRANGE  *
 MATERIAL NOT KNOWN TO MAN.  THE ORB  *
 WAS KEPT IN THE ROYAL PALACE OF      *
 FERRONRAH, BUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO     *
 LORD WOOD OF GELNOR LAUNCHED AN      *
 ASSAULT ON THE PALACE AND OBTAINED   *
 THE ORB.  LORD WOOD AND HIS BEST     *
 MEN WERE NOT ABLE TO DESTROY THE     *
 ORB WITH THEIR COMBINED MAGICAL      *
 POWERS.                              *
     NIKADEMUS, UPON HEARING OF THE   *
 ASSAULT CAME BACK TO FERRONRAH WITH  *
 HIS ARMY AND RETRIEVED THE ORB, AND  *
 LORD WOOD BARELY ESCAPED WITH HIS    *
 LIFE.  THE ORB HAS SINCE BEEN MOVED  *
 TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION.              *
     THE CURSE REMAINS ON FERRONRAH   *

    GETTING BETTER

    GETTING AROUND

      Due to the relative lack of dungeons or distance to travel to get 
to them, it's pretty clear which town goes where.  "Only from" means you 
can only get to one place from another town.

Deathport)
ORB DUNGEON        | BLACK MOOR(8)--E, only from DEATHPORT(7)
STRAW HUT          | FERRON(6)--west
SUMMER CASTLE      | LLITHFAEN(4)--north

Note that leaving Demoniac kicks you to (3,2) Underworld(i.e. the first 
level,) and leaving Deathport kicks you to (1,2) overworld, east of 
Saxlingham.


    GETTING THROUGH

  Well, once you know what to do the game is really rather simple, 
except for the waiting for random encounters bit.
  Monster 1, Pluto's Giant Constrictor, seems to be found at random in 
the overworld.  I combed it(i.e. move all the way left, down one, all 
the way right, etc.) and eventually got the sucka.  It was actually the 
last one I found before I went to the second level of the underworld.  
If you cannot find it after combing the continent you probably do not 
want to save the game, especially if you have humans in your party.  The 
continent has 20*26*9=4680 squares(well, a few less for water, etc.) and 
that can add up to quite a few years for your characters.  It makes up 
for its relative ease by being incredibly tough to find.
  Monster 2, Pluto's Winged Devil, seems to be found at random in a 
dungeon.  I found it in the straw hut, and you are well advised to 
continue resetting dungeons until things work out--or at least to have a 
backup disk you can reset to.
  Monster 3, Pluto's Undead Snake, is really rather easy to find.  It's 
on the desert isle southeast of Gelnor.
  Monster 4, Pluto's Demon Fly, is in the upper left, on the isle with 
the inn.
  Monsters 5 and 6 are in the astral plane.  Once you've figured out how 
to get there, cast spell 57 a whole bunch.  It's not terribly exciting, 
but eventually you'll hook your fish.  It seems to take longer the 
second time.  Maybe that's because at first there's a 10% chance of 
getting 5 or a 10% chance of 6 when the computer calculates, and with 
one monster down one of these cases is invalid.  Be warned of potential 
tedium.
  Monster 7, Pluto's Giant Wyvern, is in Pluto's Smallest Castle and 
easy to find if you know the right way to get in.
  Monster 8, Pluto's Dragon Demon, is in Pluto's Menagerie in the lower 
left.  You'll have random setbacks getting there but again you may want 
to save the dungeon along the way;  there are several encounters you 
have to face before you can get close, and with the draining trek you 
also have to make, you will need as little margin for error as possible.
  Monster 9, Pluto's Ice Dragon, is in Pluto's Menagerie in the lower 
right, only you do not kill it.  You give it the orb.  In order to 
approach it you need to have used the eight amulets that you got from 
the first eight monsters.  Then everyone in your party should have all 
eight beast runes.

  That is the game in a nutshell.  However, finding out how to go about 
this is a bit more difficult.
  In the Kobold Village an oracle can help you, and you can build up 
your characters.  Nothing critical though yet except for the code to get 
to the first level of the underworld.
  In the straw hut Filmon gives you even more information including the 
scroll about the monsters.
  In the Summer Castle, if you rescue the Princess she tells you how to 
destroy the orb.
  In the laboratory on the island, you find a teleporter and use the 
code you got in the Kobold village.
  On the first level of the underworld, one dungeon(north-a-ways) 
contains the orb, and the other contains the divine spell as well as the 
code for the second level of the underworld.
  Go to the astral plane and visit the forgotten temple on the second 
underworld level(poke around in the water for a vortex both times,) 
which gives you another number clue.  This will help you get to monster 
9.
  Go to the second level of the underworld through the island lab.  
Visit Pluto's smallest castle but be sure to enter the right way.
  Visit the final dungeon.  You'll have to trace back to use the final 
amulet, but once you do you can go back and face the ice dragon.  Hey

  The dungeon in the corner is not particularly critical.  I think you 
can sneak through the game without it.  The dungeon is the Straw Hut 
where you find Filmon.

  Town number 6, Ferron, is in the south.  There's not much else to see 
here except for the ruins, which seem to be here for Local Flavor.

  This is a non-critical sector.  The inn here is called "The Salty 
Tavern."  If you want to explore all the towns, going this way is as 
good as going through (1,0), although I would really recommend learning 
transport.

is the most useful of all the dungeons in the game.

  This is, of course, the first scene your party will see when you leave 
Pippacott(1).  To the southeast you'll find Pluto's Monster number 
three, but you probably don't want to mess with it yet when starting 
out.  The Kobold Village is a good place to go to start, but once you 
get better the meager experience points won't be worth the constant 
hassle of the trivial fights.  The inn here is called "The Albatross," 
and all squares are visible as you walk around.

  There is relatively little to explore here.  You learn a spell which 
you need to cast repeatedly.  It's a bit annoying waiting for the 
correct encounter and, in fact, you have to do so twice.  In order to 
get here you needed to find a vortex, and that is the same method you 
need to get out of here, although the entrance to the vortex is smaller.  
Skirting the shores and jumping in the water generally works.  Be sure 
to heal up before entering the second level of the underworld, which has 
some nasty lava.

  Yeegh.  You'll have to take a little damage walking across the lava to 
get to the good parts, and you may have to come back later.  You can't 
access the island since you're not allowed to swim in the Styx.  The 
dungeon, the cold wet cavern, has some important information as well as 
a special ability that you will need to win.

  Once transported here you land on the +.  Deathport(7) is the town to 
the northwest.  Note that if you enter it, you will be kicked back to 
the overworld on exiting unless you cast town transport.  You can only 
move to the other town on the first level, and if you don't, you are 
kicked out to the path east of Saxlingham.  It's actually not a bad idea 
to use town transport, as you avoid some nasty lava that way.

  There's stuff to do in each direction--a dungeon each way.

  Black Moor(8) is the town in the upper left.  The lava isn't the 
terribly nasty sort but will still do damage.  The dungeon contains a 
very valuable item.  You can't reach the island as the game doesn't 
allow you to swim the Styx.

  Here's where the major lava begins.  You'll notice a path through it.  
You'll need to go through it multiple times, but a trace will be left 
from the first time you walk through;  this is an example of how the 
terrain being invisible until you walk over it benefits you.  In case 
you forgot the rules for going to the final dungeon, you can just guess 
the way.  Remember that you see the areas around you, so you'll want to 
stay in the center of the path of vision carved out.  Note two rather 
nasty tricks in the lava patterns:
  1.  If you go a bit too far in the direction you're supposed to, the 
game lets you slide until you make a turn.  Then you're exposed to the 
deadlier lava.
  2.  You're always hit up for a little damage whenever you change 
direction.  Be sure to check up on your damage a few times along the 
way, and remember to save some heal spells after you leave the dungeon, 
as the return trip may be costly as well.

  The final dungeon, with Pluto's last two monsters, is here.  You'll 
need to visit it twice.  

  The Forgotten Temple is where you will wind up after going through the 
vortex that started in the Astral Plane.  While it is technically 
possible to reach the final dungeon from the Forgotten Temple, your 
party will be very beaten up by the time they get there.  I suppose if 
you go on a direct diagonal WNW, etc. you will make it, but it will be 
very costly.  As you need to visit Pluto's Smallest Castle anyway you 
might as well figure the other way to get to the second level.

s = where you start after teleporting here

  Pluto's Smallest Castle is the dungeon to the southeast of the town.  
You'll need to watch out a bit for the lava bed as this level is largely 
invisible until you start walking around.

  The town, Dark Abyss, is a good place to rest, and since you will have 
to return to a town after the final dungeon, you'll wind up visiting 
it(see (1,1) for the problems with Demoniac.)

  The best way to enter the dungeon, Pluto's Smallest Castle, is from 
the center west.  Any other way and you will have to fight Pluto, who is 
very tough to beat.

  There's not much to do here.  Entering and leaving Demoniac, the town, 
is not recommended unless you wish to be transported back to the first 
level of the underworld.  You can however cast transport to town number 
ten, Dark Abyss.  If you are returning from a dungeon and want to play 
it safe, that is the best time to enter this town.  Again visibility is 
bad, so watch out for any lava you stumble onto.

  The instructions for the walk to the final dungeon also begin at 
Demoniac.

  DUNGEONS

    GENERAL LEGEND

  x = exit
  ~ = secret passage
  | = door(need lock-pick skill)
  - = door(need lock-pick skill)
  ! = encounter
  : = trap
  ; = you hear monsters, go back? [door or open space, but probably 
door]
  $ = treasure.  If there is any specifically valuable treasure not in 
the descriptions I will try to note it.
  ^ = stairs.  While nothing happens to your party on these squares I 
may as well be complete.
    The more detailed descriptions of the room may be described 
qualitatively.  In general we assume a corridor is one unit wide in 
these descriptions, and a room is anything that isn't, although most of 
the time it will be rectangular in shape.  Rooms will have a description 
in some corner;  on that square, nothing special happens.

    In general the text, extracted from the Apple version, will be in 
ALL CAPS.  My comments, including various sic's, will not be shouted 
quite so loudly.

OVERVIEW:  You'll have a lot of combats with kobolds and orcs as you 
work your way through here.  The oracle is the key thing to see here.  
It gives you some advice although not very detailed.  There's a nice 
treasure room in the east although you're better off finding the secret 
door.  If you want to pile up cash you can reset the dungeon continually 
and go to the dwarf at (4).  Overall this is a pleasant introduction to 
Phantasie II dungeons with nothing actually critical to solving the 
game.

The quick walkthrough is to blast straight south and visit every jail 
cell except 1 for information and gold.  Visit the oracle and then hit 
the secret door to find the treasure stash.  Also check the chief's 
house above it for scrolls.  Leave.

  "Outside in Kobold Village" is the default although you have four 
rooms of guard quarters in the northwest, a mess hall in the northeast, 
and "a simple kitchen" south of that.  The chief's house, then the 
treasure room, is below that.  There are also guard quarters to the west 
and also near the entrance.  Closets are behind the chief's house and 
the mess hall with treasure in the second.  A garbage pit is in the 
center, as well as general living quarters.  An armory with wooden items 
is below the guard's quarters, with captains' houses below that.  The 
detention area with many cell blocks is beolw that, although the oracle 
room is just west of the cell block with the secret door.

A : a trap, arrows or boiling oil.
K : encounter with Kobolds/Orcs
L : encounter with Orcs
M : encounter with Scribes
N : encounter with Ranger/Wild Dog
O : encounter with Drip Slimes
P : encounter with Drip Slime/Green Muck
Q : encounter with Giant Ants

The following happen if you return to the village and enter the cells:
--AN UNDGRATEFUL SPRITE WALKS OUT OF THE CELL.
--THERE IS ONLY A SKELETON CHAINED TO THE WALL HERE.

OVERVIEW:  well, this dungeon is pretty orderly and logical.  Once 
you've mapped out all the basic places you may notice some spots that 
are unexplored.  There are probably secret doors to them.  The main 
thing to find here is the transporter which will allow you to get to the 
first or second level of the underworld--or just kick you out if you 
made a bad choice.

This one is pretty easy as well.  Bust through south until you can't go 
any more;  you'll hit a secret door.  Then go east and south and dial in 
the correct code(47 or 66) to get to the underworld.

  Outside the castle is where you start.  The next room is Castle 
Entrance where you can use "Plain Stone Hallway" to visit the six 
circular "under a tower" locations.    Then there is the Great Hal with 
the fireplace to the south.  To the west are two messed up rooms 
smelling of goblins, with a food storage room above the kitchen to the 
east.  South of the fireplace is a secret library which leads out to two 
marble hallways.  There are also guard rooms on each side.  The rooms 
below are the torture chamber, a messed-up wizard's lab, a goblin room 
with elfskin bed, and a machine room.  At the bottom you have an empty 
stone room, chemical storage room, and unused bedroom, empty stone room, 
and a captain's room with a door you can't get open.  The very bottom 
holds strange interdimensional rooms which house the teleportals.

R : encounter with kobold/goblin
S : encounter with apprentice devils
T : encounter with zombies
U : encounter with ????
Traps are rocks or a pit.
1 : THERE IS A STRANGE MACHINE WITH MANY BUTTONS SITTING IN THE CORNER 
OF THIS ROOM,.
2 : THE MACHINE HAS TWO SETS OF BUTTONS, THE FIRST SET IS LABLELED 1-9. 
PUSH WHICH BUTTON?
THE SECOND SET OF BUTTONS IS LABELED 1-9 PUSH WHICH BUTTON? [note:  you 
can't get out of this.]
  [47 : 1st]
  [66 : 2nd]
  [others : 1-way to exit]
3 : exit to first level of underworld
4 : exit to overworld
5 : exit to second level of underworld
Leftovers:  "THERE IS A SCROLL IN THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM ROOM."

OVERVIEW:  Lots of traps and encounters with implings in this dungeon.  
You may wish to save the pools for last as if you step in a wrong one 
you may be toast.  There are also some scrolls here if you can navigate 
secret doors.

The quick walkthrough is to head for the pool room and pick up the spell 
in the pool marked ?.  Then go back up, find the secret doors to get 
around the gate at 3, and get the two scrolls.  Then leave.

  Room of pools in the southwest, with a cold wet cavern in the north 
and south thirds and a carved stone passage in between.  You also have 
four irregularly shaped rooms(impling hatcheries) off to the side.  
There are the assistant imp keeper's and imp keeper's rooms as well in 
the lower right.

  Extra space going around the gate does not appear on the Apple.  The 
benefit is that you can see something kitty-corner and figure out 
something's there.

T : encounter with implings
U : encounter with priests/scribes
V : encounter with death fly/bantir
W : encounter with BEEPING BLOBS!!!!
Y : encounter with cobras

Rocks and a large pit are the trap.
+ = everyone gets 88 hit points.  Not necessarily a good thing.  You 
don't GAIN 88 hit points, and if you had 200, tough.
* = pool to avoid.  The lower ones can drain magic.  You've been warned!  
Some may even render spells, shields and armor useless.
? = pool gives you a divine spell.
1 : rubbish poetry alert.  A SIGN READS: 'THERE BE TWELVE POOLS SOME BAD 
AND SOME GOOD, FOR THE YOUNG IMPLINGS TO DRINK AS THEY WOULD. THIS ONE 
FACT THEY MUST NOT NEGLECT, THE POOLS TO THE SOUTH HAVE THE GREATEST 
EFFECT.'
2 : WRITTEN IN BLOOD ON THE WALL HERE IS THE NUMBER 66.  [useful on a 
machine, maybe?]
3 : WHEN YOU OPEN THE GATE AN ALARM SOUNDS AND GAS BEGINS TO FILL THE 
CORRIDOR.  THE GAS IS AT YOUR (ANKLES/KNEES/WAIST/NECK) is followed by 
THE GAS IS OVER YOUR HEAD.  At that point you take damage.

Miscellany:  "TRY TO VISIT THE ENTIRE HATCHERY."

OVERVIEW:  There are obviously secret doors to find right out of the 
gate.  The need to find them continues as you go on.  Other than that 
this dungeon is pretty smooth sailing.

The quick way through is as follows:  pull the lever at 7, then go to 9 
and pull that lever.  Now you can go south, so do so.  Push the button 
at 2 which toggles which door you can go through.  Push all the button 
in each of the three rooms beyond and the center room will open up to a 
further passage.  Fight Filmon's King Cobra and get a valuable scroll.  
Get out.  Like the Kobold Village there's nothing necessary here for the 
actual game.

  There are stone rooms on each side beneath the smelly animal cages as 
well as one in the bottom center.  There's an emergency valve in the 
small stone room but you'll want to wait to pull that one.  You'll want 
to reach the room full of books and scrolls where you'll meet Filmon.

Traps are acid and poison gas.

THERE WILL BE GREAT REWARDS."
2 : there is a button here.
3 : this is Filmon.  FILMON THE SAGE IS SITTING HERE IN A CHAIR. CHAIR. 
"IF YOU CAN FIGHT MY BEAST WITH STICKS ONLY," HE SAYS, "I WILL GIVE YOU 
SOME ADVICE." 1-"YES WE WILL" 2-"CAN WE THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE?"
  [say 1:]  FILMON SAYS, "TO REMOVE THE CURSE OF NIKADEMUS YOU MUST 
DESTROY THE ORB UPON WHICH THE CURSE IS CAST. THE ORB HAS BEEN TAKEN 
INTO THE NETHERWORLD BY THE IMPS, SO YOU MUST GO THERE."
  HE CONTINUES, "I HAVE SENT THE HALFLING PEDALOE AND THE GNOME PELZER 
INTO THE NETHERWORLD WITH NO LUCK, SO BE CAREFUL, IF YOU FIND THE ORB 
THEN PERHAPS THE PRINCESS CAN HELP YOU TO DESTROY IT... IF SHE IS STILL 
ALIVE."
  [characters were in P1:]
  "BY THE WAY," HE ADDS, "CONGRATULATIONS ON DEFEATING THE BLACK LORD MY 
OLD FRIENDS." [he actually already congratulated you in Phantasie.]
  [solved:]
  [unsolved:] "I HOPE YOU DON'T BLOW THIS MISSION THE WAY YOYUU DID ON 
GELNOR."
  HE CONCLUDES, "THE 'BOOK OF BEASTS' MAY BE HELPFUL TO YOU ON YOUR 
MISSION, BEFORE YOU GO SEEKING THE ORB YOU MUST PROVE YOUR WORTHINESS BY 
FIGHTING WITH ONLY WOODEN STICKS." [the 'book' is a scroll]

4 : button to push here.  I think it opens up one / square.
5 : button to push here.  I think it opens up one / square.

the game mentions you are swimming in water.
9 : THERE IS A LEVER HERE MARKED : "EMERGENCY VALVE ONLY!" 1-LEAVE 2-
PULL LEVER
  [Once you leave to the left you can't come back.  At the door it says 
THE PASSAGE AHEAD IS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER. YOU CAN NOT GO ANY 
FURTHER.]
A : THERE IS A LARGE GATE HERE, YOU CAN HEAR WATER SPLASHING ON THE 
OTHER SIDE.  [no way to walk there, but the water fills a pit in]
B : THE PASSAGE SLOPES DOWNWARD TO THE SOUTH VERY STEEPLY.
C : IF YOU CONTINUE TO THE SOUTH YOU WILL FALL INTO A DEEP EAST-WEST 
CHASM.

Miscellany: "DO NOT FLOOD THE PASSAGE TOO SOON."

OVERVIEW:  The object here is to get the orb and get out.  I actually 
found it in the yellow area instead of what you are told in the green 
area.  There's nothing in the red/blue areas anyway.  Jumping around in 
the pools seems to be at random.  You may want to check out the green 
area as there are prisoners there with advice.

The quick walkthrough is to push south to the orange pool.  Dive in it 
until you're at the purple or yellow.  If at the purple, hit the secret 
door to the left.  Now you're in the yellow caverns.  Barrel down and to 
the right until you get the door.  Dive in pools to get out, and leave.  
Don't worry about the caverns you can't visit.  They seem to be off-
limits and are unimportant.

BLUE CAVERN walled off to the upper right.  The coffin room and funeral 
service room are adjoined to it.  I actually have no clue how to get in 
here, but it's not important to win the game.
ORANGE CAVERN connected to natural cavern, in the southeast.
GREEN CAVERN spreads through the bottom center.
PURPLE CAVERN covers a narrow room near the west wall in the center.
YELLOW CAVERN covers the center to lower part of the map.
"CAVERN WITH REDISH TINT"(sic) in the lower right, just above the 
armory.

  [2:] HE SAYS, "THANK YOU BRAVE ONES, I AM PELZER, SENT BY FILMON, I

  HE CONTINUES TO SPEAK AS HE REMOVES A SCROLL FROM HIS CLOAK AND HANDS 
IT TO YOU YOU, "I STOLE THIS FROM THE IMPS, IT MAY BE OF USE TO YOU ON 
YOUR QUEST."
8 : green pool
9 : THERE IS A DEAD TROLL CHAINED TO THE WAL WALL WITH SEVERAL ITEMS

OVERVIEW:  lots of traps to be aware of here if you are too curious.  
Shut off the gas if it gets turned on.  You'll want to try to rescue the 
princess although there is an illusory one;  be warned!

The quick walkthrough is to head south, say you'll rescue the princess, 
and take a left at the entry hall.  Head south and when you get to the 
temple find the secret door on the right wall.  The princess is behind 
the door and if you go east you can get out quickly.

  Lots of guard's barracks here too by the outer hallways until you get 
to the bottom doors.  The armory is on the right and a large temple on 
the left with dark dingy passages beyond.  Secret meeting room is above 
the dining room and flanked by guard rooms.  There's a closet to the 
southwest of the dining room and lots of small elegant bedrooms around 
it otherwise.  Food storage is behind the kitchen to the west.  Beast 
room is east of the closet.
  A large extravagant bedroom is east of the torture chamber behind the 
dark dingy passages the priests in the temple run into.  There are also 
a storage room and a plain stone room with a decoy(behind the door) 
beyond the temple.

OVERVIEW:  This is very nasty.  Be sure you've entered the right 
way(read one of the scrolls) or that your party is very strong.  
Otherwise you'll have to fight Pluto.  Apparently there's some way to 
become a servant of Pluto, but I'm not sure how to do that.

To get through quickly, you need to enter through the middle west door 
when you're outside unless you fancy fighting Pluto, who sulks amusingly 
if you win.  There's a secret door north of the initial encounter.  The 
door to the left(NOT the passage) holds beast number seven.  If you want 
to infiltrate the castle then you can try following the great troll 
north of there.  Following him one turn will put you north of the spirit 
maze, following twice will put you east of the pit(go up, right, up, 
left to find a nice stash) and following three times gets you a scroll 
and four encounters in a row along a narrow hallway.  Whatever you do 
don't go right and up if you follow only once--Pluto is at the end 
there.  If you want to get a couple of scrolls find teleporter zero in 
the spirit maze, teleporter 1 in the devil maze, and ransack the two 
rooms to the north.  There's a secret door to the east below them.

Spirit maze in southwest(starts at C,) Devil maze in northeast.  Below 
the devil maze in the northeast you have the demon room with lots of 
combats with a closet to the right.  Below that are a room with traps, 
Pluto's Dinning[sic] room, and a weird kitchen.  There's a strange 
armory to the west which is most profitable.  There's a huge library 
above the spirit maze(treasures fourth from left on top and second from 
left on bottom should be avoided) with a temple above that(it has a 
storage area in back.)  Entrances are weird black rooms.

In the northwest, beast keeper's room is left of the assistant beast 
keeper's room at the top, with beast rooms below.  A solid black room 
where you find a troll is in the corner.

Most other places you have black eerie hall with smooth walls.

I : encounter with storm giant/centipede
J : encounter with cloud giant

  [If you manage to defeat Pluto:]  You hear a booming voice:
  "Mortals, I must congratulate you on defeating me, Pluto, in my 
material form.  I must admit that I am now powerless against you, but 
alas I am luckily immortal.  I will now travel back to my true home, 
deep in the Netherworld.  There I will generate a new material form and 
regain my magical powers.  I will be back to my old form in a matter of 
days."
  "I tell you all this so that you will not gloat over your victory, and 
so that you will know that we may someday meet again if I happen to 
decide want[sic] my items back before your tiny lifespans have expired.  
Next time I may not be so low in power.  Again I feel I must 
congratulate you on your luck."
  "Good bye, skums"

OVERVIEW:  What a tough place.  You have two side caverns to visit and a 
bunch of tough fights to go through to get there.  Then you have to get 
back to a town after that!  This is probably the best dungeon to save if 
you can't conquer it the first time.

There are eleven forced combats in the "stone passage through volcanic 
rock" before you get to the transporters.  With the transporters you'll 
be forced into a lot of random stuff.  Quick tip:  there's nothing in 
the three large smelly rooms in the center, except for fights in the 
small cages around.  The places at the bottom, left and right, are a 
cavern and an ice cavern respectively.  You have something important to 
do in each one.

a : transporter where you can choose a number 1-6.  If you choose one 
you are randomly transported, perhaps back to where you started.  If you 
go somewhere you haven't been before, it says "YOU ARE SWARMED BY 
GUARDS."  Random combat follows.
E : encounter with high devil
F : encounter with storm giants/centipede
G : encounter with cloud giants
H : encounter with overlords
I : encounter with wizard/lesser wizards

1 : A SIGN READS: "PLUTO'S MENAGERIE - OFF LIMITS TO ALL UNAUTHORIZED 
MORTALS."
2 : A SIGN READS: "HE WHO ENTERS THE MENAGERIE WITHOUT PERMISSION BEWARE

COULD NOT DEFEAT THE BLACK LORD AND YOU WILL NOT HARM MY BEASTS"/"YOU 
WERE LUCKY TO DEFEAT THE BLACK LORDBUT YOU MAY FIND YOUR LUCK HAS RUN 
OUT! SIGNED PLUTO!"
4 : YOU ARE IN A COMPLETELY WHITE, ICY CAVERN WITH ICICLES GROWING FROM 
THE CEILING. YOU SMELL DEATH IN THE AIR.
5 : Pluto's beast number eight.
6 : Pluto's beast number nine.  Script:
  THERE IS A HUGE WHITE DRAGON HERE WATCH-ING YOU AS YOU APPROACH. 1-

  [if you don't have the 8 runes:] THE PARTY IS TOO TERRIFIED TO 
APPROACH.
  [if you do:] YOU ARE NOW ABOUT FIVE FEET FROM THE DRAGON. 1-ATTACK 2-

  [choose 2:] THE DRAGON SAYS, "I HAVE ONLY ALLOWED YOU TO COME THIS 
CLOSE BECAUSE I DETECT A STRANGE PRESENCE AMONGST YOU."/THE DRAGON SAYS, 
"YOU ARE THE ONLY MORTALS WHO HAVE EVER SEEN ME BUT WILL YOU LIVE TO

  [choose 3:] THE DRAGON SAYS, "I AM VERY HUNGRY MY FRIENDS, WHAT HAVE 
YOU TO EAT OTHER THAN YOUR MEASLY BODIES?" FEED THE DRAGON: 1-GOLD 2-THE 
ORB 3-YOUR WEAKEST PARTY MEMBER
    [choose 1:] THE DRAGON SAYS, "I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT."
    [choose 3:] THE DRAGON SAYS, "THAT WRETCH IS NOT EVEN EVEN ONE 
MOUTHFUL."
    [choose 2:] THE DRAGON APPROACHES THE ORB WITH GREAT EFFORT. HE 
TAKES THE ORB IN HIS MOUTH AND GRINDS IT UP WITH HIS POWERFUL JAWS. THE 
GROUND BEGINS TO TREMBLE AND CRACK AND GREAT ENERGY IS RELEASED FROM THE 
DRAGON'S MOUTH. THE DRAGON SPITS OUT A MANGLED PEICE OF METAL AND SAYS, 
"THANK YOU, BY DESTROYING THE ORB I HAVE DESTROYED THE EVIL THAT HAS 
POSESSED ME." HE FLIES AWAY.

7 : door which requires a code.  That code is 83.  If you mis-type, THE 
PARTY IS TELEPORTED HIGH INTO THE AIR THEN FALLS TO THE GROUND.

Other unused miscellany:
--THE DRAGON SAYS, "THE ORB HAS BEEN DESTROYED ALREADY, WHY DO YOU 
BOTHER ME NOW MORTALS?"
--"PRESS THE NUMBERS OF THE BEASTS AND YOUWILL COME TO THE ICE DRAGONS 
CAVE , BUT IT MAY TAKE YOU A WHILE."

  CHEATING

    Tsk, tsk.  This section contains spoilers so please be careful.

    First of all I should mention that cheating attributes up to a 
ridiculous level can backfire.  You may not be able to learn spells, and 
training may cost 15000 gold for the first level;  cost of training 
varies with the abilities you've acquired.  Improving attributes to 99 
and skills to 255 also frequently caused the Apple version to flip out 
when I went into encounters.  I recommend 40 across the board and giving 
one person 255 skills.

    Even though the Apple does not work, understanding it will help you 
to capture a wrinkle with the Commodore.  I consider the starting offset 
for each character to be at the place where the name starts.  This makes 
it easier to search for the character's name in a hex dump as the names 
appear on the hex dump.  I suspect that the information for the 
character starts at 0x83 before the name itself.  Each character takes 
up 170(0xaa) bytes and the characters are often(about 170/256 of the 
time) spread out over different sectors.  On the Apple, sectors cycle as 
follows:

start at y000 -> y700 -> ye00 -> y600 -> yd00 -> y500 -> yc00 -> y400 -> 
yb00 -> y300 -> ya00 -> y200 -> y900 -> z000

(this is standard for BASIC and also assisted my text-mapping of the 
game's various areas.)

    If a character is broken in two sectors and you can't figure it out 
just see where the previous/next slot's sector is and change the hex 
value accordingly.  For instance if a character's name starts at x36f0 
and you want to change something x14 bytes ahead, d is the sector after 
6 so you'd look in 0x3d04.  However if the name started at 0x3610 and 
you wanted to change something 0x62 behind, then e is the sector before 
6.  0x3eae would be the byte to edit.

    For the Commodore it is a bit trickier.  If going back would cause 
you to skip a boundary you have to, in addition to changing sectors, 
move backwards another two bytes.  That is because in each 256-byte 
block the Commodore has two initializing bytes at the beginning.  
Alternatively you can just move up from the start.  In any case numbers 
appear to be ac/54 away from each other instead of aa/56 away.  In 
addition, the sectors jump around a bit more randomly with the 
Commodore.  I created a bunch of characters named "AA01" through "AA21" 
and was able to produce the byte values.

    On the Apple, for characters 38-40 you have fire, water and earth 
elementals.  These characters are 22-24 on the Commodore.

Here's where to start the hacking if you can remember the slot names.

Here are the bytes to hack in a hex editor.  Search for the name if you 
forget the slot.  Note the "from name start" negative values.  I've 
sometimes put notes there but if there aren't any just change the hex 
byte to the desired value.  I'd generally advise not giving more than 
99(x63) as three-digit numbers could goof up the display slightly.

7 = OGRE
8 = GNOLL
9 = TROLL

b = ORC
c = GOBLIN
d = LIZARD MAN
e = MINOTAUR
f = UNDEAD

You can save a game, change to a certain race, and back, which may help 
for certain puzzles.

To change a special item(less risky than outright editing) you can do 
the following:
  1) buy scroll 1(easy to find)
  2) open up the image in a hex editor.  Just after your character's 
name there should be the number x79 with descending numbers after it.  
That is scroll 1.
  3) add to that number.  To see scroll 14, add 0xd, i.e. put 0x86.  
Save the game.  You can now read scroll x86.
  See my section on special items to get any other item you want.  Of 
course you can do this to more than one item at a time and even get ring 
nine this way.

  There is also a less technical process for duplicating items.

  Shay Addams's "Quest for Clues" describes the process as follows, 
although first you will need to make a backup "dummy" disk.  If you have 
an emulator, this is not hard, and in fact you can try this trick with 
two backups first so you don't ruin your main game if something goes 
wrong:

    1.  enter town A
    2.  sell off the items you want to duplicate
    3.  teleport to town B
    4.  remove main disk, insert dummy
    5.  teleport to town C
    6.  remove dummy, insert main disk
    7.  teleport to town A
    8.  buy the new items that have mysteriously appeared in the town 
armory's inventory!

  ERRATA

    You can bring a fighter over to the underworld and back with only a 
penalty of two months if you add him to your party at an inn.
    The world of Phantasie is very modern.  Not only do you have roads 
well in advance of other RPG's, but there are banks.  And they even have 
bank fees!  That's right.  Every time you distribute the gold(which you 
must do when you enter a town) the gold gets rounded down to the nearest 
multiple of the total number of shares.  In fact you may even find that, 
if you try to split up 6000 gold equally among 6 people, you wind up 
with 999 gold each.  Too bad society isn't advanced enough to have 
consumer advocacy!

VERSIONS/CREDITS

1.0.0 submitted to GameFAQs.com on 12/20/2001.  I believe this is a very 
adequate first draft although I imagine errors always seem to leak 
through.

Thanks to theunderdogs.org for the manual images, project64.c64.org, 
ftp://arnold.c64.org, ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net, Evin's Apple Emulator 
Page(which is sadly part down now) and Delorie GPP freeware that allowed 
me to extract information from the files.  Also kahei's hex 
editor(www.kahei.com) helped me to locate lots of data.

Shay Addams's _Quest for Clues_ book was invaluable when it came to 
checking my work.  I frequently referred to it and although I have not 
directly quoted anything from it besides the duplication cheat, it has 
still been a huge help and has probably influenced my solution in ways 
unimaginable.  At the very least it saved me a lot of time as a great 
reference guide.
