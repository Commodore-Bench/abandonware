================================

  1. INTRODUCTORY FLUFF, ERR, STUFF

  A lot of the dialogues are incomplete as I couldn't track the names in the 
files, which appear to be encoded. Maybe I'll have a crack at the Apple 
images. But the important stuff should be here.

    1-1. WHERE TO FIND IT, WHAT ABOUT IT

  www.the-underdogs.org has Rings of Zilfin in PC form. You can download the 
game from there. I recommend the PC version over the Apple emulator/disks. 
It's easier to get started, both arranging the files AND not getting your 
butt kicked right away.

  You can also use DosBox at dosbox.sourceforge.net to run Zilfin. It's much 
more convenient to have the DOS game in a window. Install and add "mount c 
c:\" (without quites) to the end of DOSBOX.CONF. Also, you can hit ctrl-F12 
to speed up things like combat or walking from one town to another. The in-
town dawdling, however, remains slow no matter how I fidget with it.

  RoZ was the game that preceded the fantastic Magic Candle series I like so 
much. It's in dumpy 4-color and has lots of drawn-out cut-scenes, but the 
rudiments of dialogue and trade that pop up, along with creative items and 
cute side characters, make the game interesting. It's only a 1-person RPG and 
the map is a string of locations without mazes, but it's worth a look. 
Especially with an application that keeps it running speedily.

  Oh--and Reis, the hero of RoZ, is referred to in MC3. His sword apparently 
becomes famous.

    1-2. STARTING TIPS

    If you're playing on the PC, I *strongly* recommend the easiest 
difficulty, which is in there for a reason. The game was probably a bit too 
hard on the Apple with no difficulty level other than the hardest. You can 
choose a level from 0 to 9 and your starting stats are based on it. Let x be 
the starting difficulty:
  # of bows = x+1.
  endurance = 200(x+1).
  food = 10(x+1).
  fatigue = 50(x+1).
  arrows = 10(x+3).
  gold = 10(x+2).
  gems = x/3.

    You can improve most stats through combat and bartering(if you don't want 
to cheat with the data below, keep track of prices for commodities.)  
However, you need to find special places to improve the following:  maximum 
strength, current strength, magic level. As for finding items useful in 
combat, some may be bought at several places or found after a battle. There 
are, of course, special items that no amount of fighting will uncover.

    As for travel, you always walk from left to right regardless of your path 
on a compass. Rings of Zilfin is divided up into about 100 locations, and 
although many just contain a fight, it's important to keep a good map so that 
you won't be circling around.

    Towns and villages have a basic format. A town has three buildings you 
can go to, labeled (F)irst, (S)econd, and (T)hird. A village has (F)irst and 
(S)econd but also a (T)alk option instead. The (T)alk is critical. Each town 
has three talkers--a dwarf or halfling, an old man, and a kid who says he 
doesn't talk to strangers. However, they may be shape shifters--you can't 
tell, and it's pretty random. Waiting to talk to each species can be tedious, 
especially with the long twiddling walks everyone makes, but it's necessary.

  Starting in RoZ is tedious but once you manage to get some critical items, 
combats become much easier.

    1-3. STARTING TEXT

  "Night time in the village of Sham. All the folks have gone home, and the 
lights are slowly going out. [you] wakes up from a restless slumber with a 
cold sweat. He dreamt about the goblins again! He goes to the window for some 
air. A shadow moves among the trees as he starts to feel an evil presence! A 
voice whispers in his mind urging him to run for his life! He does not 
hesitate for long. Quickly gathering his weapons, all the valuables he can 
find, and the food in the kitchen, [you] runs to the front door.

  After quickly scanning the shadows, he decides to run south and disappears 
from sight. Suddenly Dzomon appears! He realizes that he just missed [you], 
whom his master ordered to be killed! So begins your quest . . . for the 
Rings of Zilfin.

    1-4. CONTROLS

  You can use the number pad or arrows to move around, whether in the big map 
or along the road. You can use either/or for combat as well. However, you 
need to know that combat is real time, so if you want to pause the game you 
have to push [esc] to see your stats, or you can push S(sword attack) or 
A(arrow attack) and just not give a direction.

  You can use 5 to go back into a town, and in fact if you, say, go to a 
temple and win a fight, you can exit the town and go right back in. If you 
just visit different buildings the temple will still be empty.

  When walking from one town to another the right arrow speeds you up(up to 
3, which is 4 fatigue per 5 miles) or down. 2 units is 2 fatigue per 5 miles.

  L)ook, G)et and D)rink while walking between towns. T)alk to monks to see 
what they have to say. You have to toggle walking/running with the space bar.

  W)ord is how you talk to someone in a location that's not really a city. 
It's a bit tricky, but oh well.

*******************
* NOTE: IMPORTANT *
*******************

  When you're traveling from one town to another, I refer to WALKING as when 
you have a speed of 1/3 and BROWSING when you can move around more slowly and 
look at, drink, and get items. Often you will need to stop walking before you 
get to a mushroom you want to pick. The game will send you to a town before 
you can reach the mushroom while walking. But if you stop traveling at the 
right time and go manually to the right side of the screen, you'll get it. 
This can be critical with, say, +200 pools and often you can use it to boost 
yourself before a big fight with goblins along the road.

  One annoying thing about RoZ is that it quits when you save the game, and 
then you have to see the "reboot" scene. It's sped up with DOSBox, another 
reason to use that fine program. Plus you can have this walkthrough in one 
window and the game in another.

    1-5. BASIC ITEM STUFF

      1-5-1. WEAPONS AND ARMOR

Necessary strength/maximum damage for each weapon:
Shortsword 0-9
Pala 10-29 (useless)
Slicer 30-49
Slayer 50-69
Grandsword 70-99

Damage = strength, unless you are wielding a weapon with maximum damage below 
your strength. So someone with 75 strength would do 69 damage with a slayer 
and 75 with a greatsword.

I've labeled the Pala useless because, after getting 30 strength, assuming 
you have enough Prihny you can get to 39 right away, making the slicer 
better.

Light/Medium/Heavy Armor reduces enemy's hits by 5/15/30 respectively. Very 
worth it.

      1-5-2. MUSHROOMS & FLOWERS

  You can't buy them, so you have to pick them on the way to and from towns. 
There are no bad mushrooms to pick, although some are better than others.

--Yurpin increases endurance from 50-70 per. You can eat more than one in or 
before the heat of battle. If you go over your previous maximum HP, you get a 
new maximum.
--Tergin increases your fatigue number. Like Yurpins, you can eat them en 
masse, and if you go over your previous maximum, you set a new one. But it's 
best to wait until after you're healed up if there are no emergencies.
--Parzin raises your sword skill. Used with Purlet it gives you a near-sure 
kill, and you can do this just before going into a tough battle. You can 
combine several for multiple hits in a big fight, too.
--Fuhyin helps with food, one unit of food per mushroom. It's not really 
useful for anything else, but it's good in an emergency. I tend to use it 
right when I find it, but on the other hand I really should be buying food. 
And early on when you're saving cash, you don't have to spend food money if 
you get a bit lucky.

--Purlet makes your next swing worth 200...if you connect.
--Mift leaves you invulnerable to the next hit. No endurance is lost.
--Iola cures poison, which is nice if you're drinking out of random pools 
trying to find one that gives +200 hit points or fatigue.
--Jinn = Mift * 5. You can only eat one at a time.

      1-5-3. SPELLS

Level 1:
A. Jazzip 5 fatigue, 5 damage to 1 enemy
E. Buzzap 15 fatigue, 5 damage to all enemies(best w/3 or 4)
G. Ekbert 10 fatigue, tells you about enemy
H. Ak-Lin 20 fatigue, 50 shield
K. Warton 25 fatigue, protect from theft

  Of the level 1 spells Buzzap is pretty useful, Exbert is useful against a 
monster that's kicking your butt for later reference, and Ak-Lin is great 
just after you've healed and just before a big fight. Cast it a bunch, get 
fatigue healed, and go back to rest some more. Assuming you're loaded with 
gold--and by the time you need to do this, you will be. Warton is too taxing 
at the beginning, and you have too much gold to bother near the end.

  Jazzip works well at borders/gaps. Buzzap doesn't work there at all. In 
fact, Jazzip is better than Rektar if you are fighting Dragon Birds and the 
like. They only take one hit, and Jazzip uses less energy.

Level 2:
B. Rektar 20 fatigue, 40 damage to 1 enemy. Obviously better than Jazzip, per 
spell points.
I. Ilk-Be 35 fatigue, 99 shield. A slight bargain compared to Ak-Lin. 12% 
less fatigue used for your shield.
J. Ud-Bar 90 fatigue, immediate teleport. GREAT for near the end of the game 
when you're sick of dumb fights. It is best over LOOONG stretches, i.e. 40+ 
miles.
L. Zytrom 40 fatigue, 99 damage to HHRRUULL. You need a Grumm tree staff to 
execute this. And it is necessary. If you're clever, for only one or two 
fights.

Level 3:
C. Fagatr 40 fatigue, 99 damage to 1 enemy. Even better per spell points, but 
drains a lot of fatigue.
D. Stohle 75 fatigue, stops foes temporarily. Combine with other offensive 
spells for lots of fun.
F. Parthl 35 fatigue, 30 damage to all enemies. Proportionally 150% stronger 
than Buzzap value wise and 6x as powerful.

    1-6. DOSBOX TRICK

  RoZ can get a bit tedious if you play it straight-up in DOS or without 
adjusting the cycles in DosBox. To make RoZ go faster than its regular speed, 
run RoZ after starting DosBox. Then hit ctrl-f12 until you at least 
double(I'm comfortable with 4x the speed.) Most things will be faster now 
although walking around towns is still far too slow. Then it seems hitting 
ctrl-f11 to slow things down works well.

  One thing to note, though--if you save and quit, you need to hit ctrl-f11 
to slow DosBox down before running it again. That's because the machine 
calibrates when the executable starts, so when you hit ctrl-f12 after it 
runs, it can't detect the speed it's supposed to be running at. So you can go 
a lot faster.

  Running quickly can hurt in some of the timed parts, or during combat if 
you're not quick enough. But it makes the game a lot less drawn out. In fact 
I refused to refurbish this guide until I found a way to speed the game up, 
and once I did, I was able to tear through.

  2. GENERAL STRATEGIES

    If you decide to hack the save files, you can ignore most of what's 
below. Go to section 15 for that. And just save, edit and restore when you 
get low on items. But if you want to get to your maximums the honest, or 
honest-seeming way, see below.

    2-1. LORE QUESTIONS

  When you move to certain new areas, the game asks you these questions, and 
they aren't too tough to answer, but they can catch you off guard. You can 
keep restoring until you get a right answer, or you can just follow this 
cheat sheet.

A Pala needs how much Strength? 10

How many villages are in Sumaria? 4

How much fatigue does using Jinn cost? 50

What is the maximum Sword Skill? 66

How much damage does Rektar do? 40

How much fatigue does Parthl cost? 35

How many towns are in Begonia? 5

At what age was the hero orphaned? 10

    2-2. WHERE TO GO FIRST

  You don't want to go too far out of your way initially. There are serious 
roadblocks to going certain ways, and by process of elimination you can 
figure out where you need to go. If you are playing on the easiest level, 
though, there's a lot you can get away with. You can bull through to the west 
twice, fighting through a bunch of goblins and fleeing from the poison plants 
in Feldor North forest. Tht gets you to Perimon, where there is a healer. On 
lower levels, it's a bit safer to stick to Telbiz/Ziad back and forth with 
Tol-Bin to the east of Ziad(more healers,) piling up gold and maximum 
endurance, but I find that going west to the harder combats is worth the 
risk.

  Your major starting objectives are 1) to get your endurance to 2000 if it 
isn't already and 2) to buy heavy armor, so goblins can't damage you at all. 
Once you do that, you can fight tougher monsters, and the weakest monsters' 
hits won't damage you.

    2-3. TRADING STRATEGIES AND DEALING WITH AFFLUENCE

  First, don't go into a trading post unless you have something to buy/sell. 
Getting robbed sucks. In fact, try to keep your gold low when you leave 
there. It's random and happens to the best of players.

  Trading can get you handsome profits. To raise capital at first, you 
probably need to win fights in the temple at Telbiz. This gets you a gem each 
time. Be prepared to have 300 hit points before doing so, although having a 
purlet/parzin combo can make things quite easy. Your ultimate goal for the 
big trade is to work the Perimon/Telbiz route, buying tobacco in Telbiz and 
toys in Perimon and selling vice-versa. This gives a very nice profit. You 
can buy tobacco for 51 if you say N and then offer that price. You can also 
sell gems for 44. Every penny counts early on, especially since you still 
need to afford food.

  The profit for Telbiz/Perimon is astounding: buy tobacco for 51, sell it 
for 130, buy 14 toys for 98 and get healed for 30 in Perimon, and sell the 14 
for 36 each. You can haggle a bit again. That makes 504 gold from 51, almost 
a 9* profit, and that's if you just bring one tobacco unit over. I prefer to 
bring at least 3. You will want a profit of 800 gold to buy the heavy armor. 
You might as well get the very good stuff first.

  The poison plants for this trip may be annoying, but you can either see the 
fleeing part in section 10-4 or just heal completely in Perimon, where it's 
cheap anyway. If the plants are too tough early on, just walk between Telbiz 
and Ziad and, later, Ziad and Tol-Bin to drink from pools. Rest in an inn if 
you need to. Harvesting Yurpins and Tergins will increase your maximum(if you 
eat a Yurpin/Tergin and it sends your endurance/fatigue over the previous 
high, you increase your maximum) so a steady diet of walking and harvesting 
should hold you in good stead. If you can hold off on healing until you make 
it to Tol-Bin or Perimon(healers) and then eat the mushrooms, that is ideal.

  Gold is maximized at 9000 so after you get close you'll want to get heavy 
armor(Ziad) and boots(Telbiz) and then stock up on spice, which sells nicely 
in Begonia. Also, any gems you get are good to sell.

  But actually there are more ways to think ahead; the amounts of food and 
all mushrooms and arrows are stored in 2 bytes, and I am pretty sure the 
maximums are 9000 for all of them. So if you can buy 9000 arrows(3600 gold in 
Ziad) or 1000 food(you don't need to max this out) you can have a much easier 
way with monsters. Problem is you'll also need to buy a bunch of bows, but 
given that you can get 3000 gold for selling toys, you can get 90 bows in 
Telbiz easily. It's probably overkill, but not having nearly enough is much 
more inconvenient in this game. Oh, buy 25 elvish boots in Tol-Bin too. You 
probably have the money, and they do tend to wear out.

  Also note that the first time your endurance/fatigue go below zero, you get 
a warning--the next one will kill you. It's often useful to have a ton of 
Yurpins or Tergins on hand to remedy the situation quickly. Ideally they're 
used after healing--but remember that you have to GET to the healers.

    Go as fast as you can down paths(right arrow) or you will find that your 
own fatigue more than offsets your character's fatigue, which is negligible.

    2-4. BEYOND DELORIA

  I've found that you probably just need 4000 maximum fatigue to get through 
the game. However, a bunker(6000) would be nice. It's best to get 9000 hit 
points before leaving Deloria.

  Your main first objective in Begonia will be finding someone to get you to 
level 2. Once you do that, you can jump around with Ud-Bar, even back to a 
healer quickly to reduce the fatigue of casting Ud-Bar, which is often more 
efficient than walking a bunch(4 per 5 miles, plus nighttime attacks and 
usually a fight) or maybe first to a town to sell a few items that will buy a 
bunch of healing.

  You need an item from the Dark Tower before advancing to Sumaria, and once 
you do, you have several other places to look. There are a few nasty dead 
ends.

  3. WALKTHROUGH

  First time I played through, I just wanted to get out of Deloria and to 
Begonia and Sumaria ASAP. As it turns out, if you can buy items in Deloria, 
it's best to do so, because they are cheaper, and it's easier to walk around. 
You won't have to find much tougher monsters holding them until later. You 
could also just byte-edit cheat to gain the ring and 4 chewbas and the cloak, 
horn, ring and maybe the rope. But I think it's fun just to go and see all 
the items and places.

  You'll want to save every time you find an item. This forces you to 
restart, but things can go wrong--the biggest one for me was drinking from a 
poison pool and not having an Iola or forgetting to eat one.

    3-1. BRIEF, YET ANNOTATED

    Character improvements, while not all *completely* necessary, will make 
the game a lot easier. Actually, you do need to get level 3 magic to beat the 
HHRRUULLs. I've listed below the rough steps, in approximate optimal order.

      **** DELORIA ****
--POWER: buy heavy armor in Ziad
--ITEM: buy elf boots in Tol-Bin (E)
--CASH: pile up $5000 via trading(Tol-Bin/Perimon, tobacco/toys.) $8000 to be 
extra sure.
--CHAR: go to Tumriz, talk to beggar/wizard, get 1 magic level. Silk is cheap 
here. Get 30 prihny. Get tea if you can afford it. Buy 5 torches here. (S-W-
NW-NE from Perimon)
--CHAR: go to Castle Durheim, win fight, get 30 potential strength. (SW-SE-E-
E-E-E-E-E-NW-W)
--ITEM: win 4 temple fights in Shaktir, exiting and 5(reentering) for 4 
chewba. (W)
--CHAR: find witch in Finduk to get maximum strength. (NW, NW, N)
--POWER: buy slicer in Shaktir as weapon(do full damage for your newfound 
strength). (S, SE, SE)
--GET OUT: NW, NW, N, wait for dwarf to pass by

      **** BEGONIA ****
(healing in Faerlot and Shentill)
--FUN: talk to Jimbo for 20 mifts
--ITEM: buy key in Derymin(NW, N, N)
--ITEM: fight at temple in Derymin to get Nukh. You only need one.
--DETOUR(necc?): go to N Demion to learn word of power(NW, SE)
  (you can just cheat and read it below.)
--CHAR: go to Llorim, talk to beggar, get 1 magic level(NW, NE, NE)
  [from here on out, UD-BAR comes in handy.]
--ITEM: go to Faerlot, get pearl(NE, NW) and heal too.
--CHAR: go to Castle Razag, win fight, get 30 potential strength(SE, SE, SE)
--CHAR: find witch in Maerdom to get maximum strength(SE, SE)
--ITEM: go to Tar-Im to buy riddle book(S, S)
--POWER: go back to Nedharm to buy slayer(N, N, NW, NE)
--ITEM: go to Zaradim to get the magic staff. (O)ffer pearl to Zara and (U)se 
the seed she gives you in back when the sun sets to make the staff. (W, NW, 
NE, E, [cast Ilk-be], N) Be sure to save before starting here as the sun goes 
up/down at weird times and if it comes up, it doesn't go down. I've lost all 
my food waiting for it to disappear again.
--ITEM: go to the Dark Tower and hack your way through. 4 levels. (S, W, W, 
N)
--GET OUT: S, SW, SW, SW, SW, SW, W to Karadum. Wait for a dwarf to guide you 
to the pass. Keep talking to bystanders 'til it does.

      **** SUMARIA ****
(healing in Elmo, Safinas and Varanlim)
--BROWSE(necc?): talk to monks you see to find the words for Dragos

--ITEM: go to Metsny Mountains and get the harp (NW)
--ITEM: go to Safinas and buy a flute(SW, SW, SE)--sell Silks to get max 
gold.
--ITEM: go to S Shimerr, (O)ffer the riddle book, and get the ring (SW)
--ITEM: go to Lork and buy 1 rope(NE, NW, NE, NW, NW, E, NE)
--CHAR: go to Castle Rimline, get 30 potential strength(SW, W)
--CHAR: go to Waylong and give the witch Prihny to get 99 strength(W, NE)

--ITEM: buy potion from Hayrush for 1000 gold.
--ITEM: go to the Well and get the horn(NE, SE, NE, E, NW) and use the rope, 
flute twice, offer harp.
--you probably need to heal at Varanlim right now(SE, W, SW, E) although if 
you don't feel you have enough mushrooms, you can go back and crash around 
Deloria for a while.
--LAST QUEST: go to Sharkynn Heights (W from Varanlim, NW, NE), use cloak, 
use horn, and then offer chewba 4 times to get to Castle Graz.

Eklun's words MAYGOON BI-THAR HAZMEDY get you through the wall at N Demion
There you learn DEM OGANDUR SHEM to get you into the Dark Tower. You also 
learn the final word of power for the rings, YOKKOL.
Zihten's words BELIRR ONUMDA DERHALL let you in the temple.

say SUBMIT THY RING to Dragos(thanks, Sumaria monks)
The ring's final word of power is YOKKOL.

  (At the end, you can just hit W)ord right away as that will give you all 
day to type something in.)

  Lord Dragos is destroyed!! Nothing but a pile of ash remains.
  So it came to pass that Lord Dragos was destroyed and the land was free 
once again.
  But many questions remained unanswered!
  How did Dragons manage to beat the ancient defenses built by Zilfins and 
invade Batiniq?
  Why were Zilfins hiding in Demion Rocks, and why didn't they act against 
Lord Dragos?
  Was this the final victory or could the dark forces strike again?
  In ages to follow, answers to these questions were to be found. But that's 
another story . . .

  [The end]

      NOTE:  once you get to the appropriate magic level, start casting UD-
BAR like crazy. Especially retreating to Deloria for mushrooms. It'll save 
you all kinds of time, combat, etc. Unless you need certain mushrooms, or you 
want to walk a bit before hitting an encounter, after which you can jump over 
it.

  Unfortunately there are no cool ways to die near the end. You just kick 
off.

    3-2. QUICK AND DIRTY TRICKS, GETTING STARTED ON HARD

  These tricks work regardless of the difficulty level, but the game is 
painful without them on hardest.

  Beyond byte editing, there's actually an easy way to get good quickly. If 
you find a Yurpin to start, use it. Be sure to stop immediately when you see 
the second mushroom on your way from Sham. Save at every town 'til you get to 
Tol-Bin. Go south from Sham to Telbiz. Fight in the temple and win a gem--use 
arrows until your bow breaks so you don't lose too much energy. Sell the gem 
for 44. Then break for Ziad. If you have Parzin/Purlet combinations, use one 
of each for a fight and tackle the goblin with S) (if your bow's not broken 
already) on the bottom. You can drink the water past the flower BEFORE the 
fight if you're careful. Then go east to Tol-Bin. Another goblin fight on the 
way--here, there are only two, so you may be able to get by without.

  But the key in Tol-Bin is, if you've taken a lot of hits, to pay the gold 
to recharge. On the way back, drink at the pool behind you, then the next one 
you see. You can pick the mushroom just near the end but you have to browse.

  You should have ~700 hit points now. It should be enough to fight in the 
temple, win, find 30+ gold, and go back east to Tol-Bin, beating the goblins 
along the way. This is net positive gold in all likelihood! It's certainly at 
least 400 hit points at each swoop. Don't use the Yurpins/Tergins until after 
you've healed. After a few times you may not need to pay 30 gold and you can 
start stocking up on food. Remember always to save before a temple fight and, 
if you didn't get too dinged up, after. You can take a chance with eating a 
purlet if you don't have parzin/purlet for a quick knockout, but with 1000 HP 
you may soon not need to.

  Go back north to Telbiz when you have 2000+ hit points. The cool thing now 
is that you can win a few temple fights there, buy some gems(more lucrative 
than Ziad, but less convenient when you're building up hit points,) and when 
you are down to 500 or so hit points, go back south to Ziad and east to Tol-
Bin. Just remember to have 30 GP on hand(sell a gem or two and save before 
entering a store so you don't get robbed) for the healers. Any spare leftover 
money can go to buying tobacco.

  You can keep hitting up Ziad/Telbiz but first a small interlude may make 
things interesting. In other parts of the walkthrough I recommend going to 
Perimon(2 west) about here. Sell the tobacco, buy healing and toys, and 
return to Telbiz. Sell the toys. You can repeat tobacco/toys once more and 
probably reach your maximum for toys. Then you can buy heavy armor and moot 
the question of endurance lost.

  You should also have enough money to use the inn at Telbiz. It's the best 
one to go to, because you aren't twiddling around walking everywhere. All you 
need to do is to choose the S)econd house, N-N-Y-Y, and you get a room for 
the night. That gives +50 fatigue. If you can crank it up to 3000 you're 
pretty much set. 60 trips maximum--which might be a waste of time in the 
short term but not the long term. Don't bother with the full 9000. Remember 
you'll find Terpins along the way, and after visiting healers you can just 
eat the mushrooms up en masse.

  To increase your endurance just go back to Ziad/Tol-Bin. Note now that you 
have a huge advantage over the monsters in the area. They can't damage you. 
It's an easy +400 endurance each time you go back and forth. You'll probably 
need 15-20 more of these to max out, and that's excluding any Yurpins you 
find. You'll probably be more than comfortable with 4000 for now. You don't 
want to get bored with the game too soon.

  Oh. Buy boots in Tol-Bin once you're ready in earnest. Take cash to Tumriz, 
get silk, 30 prihny and most importantly, magic. Then sweep along the south 
side and win at Durheim. No fatigue worries, so Jazzip away.

    3-3. WHAT TO DO IN OTHER CRITICAL PLACES

  In case you get boggled by which instruction to type in, I compiled a list 
below.

Sharkynn Heights: (U)se cloak and then (U)se horn. When you get to the 
Darmag, (O)ffer the chewba 4 times. That will let you in the castle.

where, and the length of time needed to get there. If you draw out a map 
you'll notice that the weighting system doesn't quite work out right. Maybe 
the roads zig-zag a lot.

  5. DUNGEON MAPS

  Dungeons can be exasperating because you can't save while you're in them, 
but they're not as bad as you might think. Also when you are in a room, it's 
tough to tell which way to go. You don't get any clues, and you have to 
guess. This is probably where my maps below come in most useful. Dungeons 
aren't really so bad if you know your way through, because you can avoid most 
of the dreaded HHRRUULLs to get to where you want to be.

  The maps shouldn't spoil too much, as you're basically working your way 
through 16x16 grids. The one danger of these maps is that it leaves out some 
of those encounters with the pairs of HHRRUULLs that are so nasty to you, but 
I've detailed ways to avoid them. Once you're in a room, you need to use your 
nukh to get out. I've never had it break on me. Anyway, here goes:

  LEDGER

    X = wall
    + = door
    H = Hhrruulls
    F = prison cell with fermigons
    P = prison cell with prisoner
    S = slave quarters
    ^ = stairs up
    V = stairs down
    = = exit
    * = where you want to get to
    . = path to go along

  INSTRUCTIONS

  To go up/down stairs, type (Y) and then (N) and (X)it.

    5-1. THE DARK TOWER

  You have to retrace your steps through the dungeon.

  Go down, left and up. Use parzin/purlet to beat the fermigons if you like. 
They're tough. The take the second down(if you like, get some tergins by 
taking the third down, (E)ntering south, and (X)iting north and going back

  (X)it west, south, east, south into the wall, and now eat some tergins and 
yurpins unless you've got each over 2000. (P)repare Zytrom. Go east. (C)ast 
Zytrom like crazy. Eat more yurpins if you have to. Go east, south, west, and 
heal up again. More HHRRUULLs. South, east, north, east, south and you'll see 
the king. He'll give you the amulet.

  Now you just need to retrace your steps. But before you get to the exit 
chamber, heal up. 5 Purlet/Parzin, an Ilk-Be spell, and a Jinn beforehand 
should help deflect Dzomon's damage. If you've got the yurpins and need to 
boost over 1250, do so. Otherwise, you'll need a lot more yurpins. Once you 
wipe him out, congratulations, you've beaten the toughest of the dungeons!

    5-2. CASTLE GRAZ

  This is a one-way trip, and you can even avoid fights if you're careful. 
You won't need the Tergins. You'll just need 2200 hit points. Maybe.

big deal. Just (W)ord YOKKOL. You win!

    5-3. SIDE CAVES

  There are a couple of caves you need to explore to get through the game. 
There's nothing too tricky, but I broke them down below.

      5-3-1. N DEMION CAVE

  This is your first run through a dungeon. It's pretty tough, more than most 
you'll find in Begonia, and since you have to take care of three monsters in 
a row, you may want to use Parzin and Purlet to knock off the monsters.

(U)se torch.
(G)o.
Iblis 340/75(magic)
Mina 350/85
Gorgon 490/99

  Past these guys, you'll talk to Eshir, the first speaker of the Zilfins. He 
tells you the words DEM OGANDUR SHEM and YOKKOL as the final word.

  You don't have to go back through the dungeon.

      5-3-2. METSNY MTNS CAVE

  This is actually a very easy dungeon, but you must have the key from 
Derymin first. Of these only the bogum is tough, especially since you're 
better than when you faced N Demion. So only use 2 parzin/purlet for that 
final fight.

(U)se the torch.
(G)o forward.

Barg 140/30
Gorgon 70/50
Zumagin 90/90
Bogum 350/150
(U)se the key. Harp + 12 gem + 1000 gold = your treasure.

  You're kicked back to the Metsny Mountains on completing this.

      5-3-3. THE WELL

  You need 3000 hit points for this if you just fight straight up, although 
you need less if you have a bunch of prihny/parzin. There's no really big 
fight after this, so why not use them? You can also cast shield to protect 
yourself.

(U)se rope. Enter. (U)se torch. (G)o. There are three fights:
Bazylrun 740/125
Gorgon 870/140
Bazylrun 795/125

  After this, you get to the other side of the caves where you need to (U)se 
flute. (U)se flute. You get to meet with the elves, which is cool.

  "Do you know what I want?" (O)ffer harp. You then get the horn in return. 
You lose 50 fatigue for climbing back up the well, but so what. You don't 
have to run back through.

  6. TOWN INFO AND COMMERCE

  Often, a town as I define it is not really a town. A more accurate term 
might be "location," but towns may be either battlefields or towns proper. 
For battlefields, all you can do is fight and (L)ook afterwards. For towns, 
there is a (F)irst and (S)econd house, and there's either a (T)hird house or 
a chance to (T)alk to strangers.

  Towns generally consist of up to three of a goods seller, healer, temple, 
arms seller, inn, and secret locations that are very, very important. Beggars 
also approach you as you leave, but they never give varying advice. You may 
get robbed too in an inn or market, but that's luck of the draw.

  There's no way to get out of the painful walks back and forth.

  Whenever you buy something, there's no way  to sell it for a lower price, 
really. Except in the case of tobacco, when you might just deserve it, you 
non-utopian minded fantasy RPG player, you, and spice, but just barely and 
then you could haggle your way to breaking even. As for basic supplies you 
can't sell, the prices never fluctuate too wildly, so there's no reason to 
get your pants in a bunch.

  Also whenever you buy or sell something, you can negotiate the price unless 
you're dealing with one of those tin pot sellers who have one item to buy and 
another to sell. You can in fact do it repeatedly. When buying, just start at 
about 10% below, or a bit more, and work up by 1 gold piece if you want to 
chisel every last bit of profit. You can do the same for selling--start 10% 
high.

  Prices for you to buy stuff vary from town to town but there's nothing to 
get your breeches in a knot about. The fluctuation is rarely more than 30-40% 
which isn't bad at all considering the 500%+ profit margins you can make if 
the time is right. Note that towns never buy and sell the same item, so you 
have to really plan your trip ahead. Also, by the time you get out of 
Deloria, you shouldn't have to do much planning to buy/sell. It's worth it to 
hang back there a bit to stock up on silk and spice, along with other hardy 
stuff like boots and prihny. Having this allows you to acquire a net worth 
much more than the maximum 9000(?) gold. Which is cool--many games don't have 
this sort of quick dirty investment feature.

  Below is a list of what sells for what, where, and a brief analysis.

Arrows(buy) group of 10 Shaktir 6, Tumriz 5, Ziad 4, Cullarat 6, Llorrim 8, 
Nedharm 5, Shakamin 10, Treil-Om 11
--These get more expensive as you go into further hostile territory. It is 
possible to stock up on arrows with a few runs between Telbiz and Perimon. 
Because you can have more than 256 arrows, it can last you for quite a while. 
Just trade up a whole ton and you will have no problems.

Boots(buy) Telbiz 80, Tol-Bin 100, Tar-Im 110, Varanlim 120
--Stock up early when trading silk or tobacco/toys. You can even go for the 
maximum.

Match(buy) Axitraz 8, Telbiz 9, Tumriz 7, Llorrim 8, Lork 8, Shakamin 12, Zax 
7
--I never use these. I go for big-picture heals.

Cloak(buy) Elmo 150
--Buy it when you get there. Have the spare cash. If you have brought silk to 
Elmo, just sell one.

Nukh(sell) Derymin 85
--There's a temple where you get the nukh from in Derymin too, but you need 
the nukh, so that is a waste of time.

Prihny(buy) Telbiz 55, Tumriz 40, Llorrim 50, Shakamin 45, Tar-Im 40, 
Varanlim 40
--Tumriz has the best deal, and since you're going there, it's worth it to 
make one more trading run to pile up gold to spend there. Plus if you buy 
Prihny in Telbiz, it's that much tougher to build up a lot of cash earlier. 
So, if you can be patient and hoard up enough money to buy 99 silks and 30 
Prihny(4000 or so gold) from Tumriz, good for you! The savings themselves 
aren't big--about 15*30=450 gold, as you really need just 30 Prihny to boost 
your strength(2-6 per Prihny) when max strength >> actual strength--but the 
point is that you delay payments long enough to do some good trading.

Key(buy) Derymin 60
--Yes, you need one of these. You don't get to use it right away, as you buy 
it in Begonia and move on to Sumaria.

Rope(buy) Lork 84, Zax 97
--Buy the rope in Lork. Zax is too obscure although if you establish a 
Deloria/Sumaria trade route you might as well get a step on things.

Flute(buy) Safinas 175
--You need one of these too. You can just sell a silk to pick it up.

Riddle book(buy) Tar-Im 75
--Yes, you need the riddle book. But just one.

Toy(buy) Perimon 7, Lork 15, Tar-Im 10
   (sell) Telbiz 30, Tumriz 23, Zax 64
--The Perimon/Telbiz route at first is great. You swap toys and tobacco. 
However, the price isn't high enough to justify doing any more unless you 
have far too much money. The profit margin's nice and you'll need to go to 
Tar-Im anyway, but it'll be a while before you get to Zax.

Silk(buy) Tumriz 35, Derymin 75, Zax 75
    (sell) Axitraz 80, Telbiz 80, Tol-Bin 220, Elmo 335, Lork 86, Safinas 
325, Shakamin 97
--It's worth having 3500 gold before you go to Tumriz to see the 
beggar/wizard, just to buy up everything there. A return trip may be awkward, 
though, and too out of the way. So buying silk anywhere is pretty good since 
if you need extra cash late in the game, there is always Safinas. Between it 
and Zax you have a pretty good trading route, and you can buy silk in Derymin 
before heading to Sumaria for the final third of the game. It isn't far from 
Tumriz to Safinas, but you might not survive.

  That aside, SILK IS THE BEST LONG TERM ITEM TO BUY AND SELL. You can't sell 
it all at once, but it makes such a nice profit and there are so many places 
to sell it, that if you run out of cash to buy a game-important item, you can 
get it from the profits you made with silk.

Tobacco(buy) Telbiz 55, Lork 40
       (sell) Axitraz 76, Tumriz 69, Llorrim 30, Shakamin 72, Tar-Im 65, Zax 
89, Perimon 130

  Tobacco is nice at the beginning, once you stock up in Telbiz and sell in 
Perimon. But it's not really worthwhile after that. Because there's nowhere 
in Sumaria to sell it for a huge profit.

Pearl(buy) Faerlot 200
--You need this. Just buy it.

Chewba(sell) Derymin 64, Llorrim 64
--You need four of these to get at temples. They're not worth selling, 
really.

Spice(buy) Axitraz 81, Telbiz 35
     (sell) Derymin 82, Llorrim 72, Lork 94, Tar-Im 80, Shentill 275, Faerlot 
375
--This is only worthwhile for one trip, but what a trip it is. Before moving 
on, pick up 99 spice at Telbiz because your trip to critical parts of Begonia 
will DEFINITELY go through Shentill, which is central to Begonia. Build up 
initial trade routes as you please. This one is almost a gimme if you study 
the map. You won't be able to sell all the spice, but oh well.

Elixir(buy) 1000
--at Hayrush's by Lake Brellent. You need one. Trade silks up to get it.

Tea(buy) Tumriz 30, Derymin 60, Llorrim 70
   (sell) Axitraz 90, Lork 75, Shakamin 77, Tar-Im 75, Varanlim 300, Zax 74
--The profit margin for Tumriz/Axitraz isn't worth the risk, and the profit 
margin for Varanlim, while nice, comes too late in the game and isn't as big 
as for silk.

Torch(buy) Axitraz 15, Tumriz 10, Derymin 10, Llorrim 12, Shakamin 10
--You really only need three of these. One for each dungeon, one of which can 
be skipped anyway: N Demion's wall, Metsny Mountains, and the Well.

  Towns are ranged alphabetically by region in the sections below. When 
commenting on the roads between the towns, I don't mention mushrooms and 
flowers, which should always be picked, unless you need to browse to them.

Ilk-be up. In fact you may want to save before entering in general.

(W)ord BELIRR, ONUMDA, DERHALL. You'll have to wait a but. (O)ffer the pearl. 
Let the sun vanish(it may start that way) and use the seed to get the staff.

  10. COMBAT RECOMMENDATIONS

    10-1. GENERAL

  Many monsters get much more powerful when you move to a different land, so 
there's no exact compendium of them. If you go through certain passages the 
monsters there will always be the same, but...

1) They don't have the same hit points, even in an ambushing group
2) They don't do the same damage, so try to take out the one that does the 
most first
3) If you're worried about getting killed, remember that if there are 4 
monsters you will, in an evenly matched fight, lose 4/10 of your hit points 
before killing the first, then 3/10, then 2/10, then 1/10.
4) Eat any parzin/purlet or jinn before the fight, not during.
5) If there are 2 fights and you have 2 parzin/purlets, and monsters have 
~200 HP, use one combo for each fight. That's because if you have, say, 2 
sets of 4 goblins, you'll face 6/10 damage from the remainder twice vs. if 
you used the parzin/purlets at once, you'd face 10/10 and 3/10, a bit more.
6) Always attack the same monster 'til he goes down.
7) You can use a Yurpin in the middle of a fight, but just don't expect the 
main screen to show the increased HP. Your [escape] screen will, though.
8) Bow and arrow are really a bit better, and you don't need to get your 
sword skill up high to win. Spells are preferable in passes and you also have 
to buy a lot of ash bows. So, when you start, use up what you have, but 
before you leave Deloria you may want to stock up.
9) If a healer is nearby, don't hesitate to use BUZZAP and then switch to 
JAZZIP when 2 enemies are left(buzzap=3*jazzip.) Similarly with the level 3 
spells, Fagatr = 3.3*Parthl, so switch from Parthl when 3 enemies are left.
10) you should always have your shield up with Ilk-Be once you get the 
chance. 99 shield even seems to nullify 100+ damage.
11) Jinns are great in a pinch.
12) Parzin/Purlet works great for critical combats. The last time you really 
need them are for the fight with Dzomon. Otherwise they're a convenience to 
get out of trouble quickly.
13) Don't feel as though you have to improve your sword skill. I've gotten 
through with <60.
14) Be proactive. Heal when you can. If you follow my instructions, money 
should be no problem.
15) Critical combats where you throw the sink at enemies include outside the 
castles and in the passes, Dzomon, and the two fights with HHRRUULLs in the 
Dark Tower.

  Fleeing monsters is very easy in abandoned towns off the road--you can 
leave before being attacked if you follow my advice in 10-4. But monsters on 
travels are impossible to flee from, and monsters in the gaps can be very 
nasty indeeed. Monsters who fly above and attack at night suck, too.

    10-2. IN THE GAPS

  Here you'll have a bigger puzzle ahead of you. In the Deloria/Begonia gap, 
you will need to have a bow/arrow with lots of shots or have JAZZIP learned. 
With the second, you can fire up shots at enemy birds before they get over 
you and drop to sting you. If you've got heavy armor they shouldn't do any 
damage, but otherwise they'll be annoying. The main problem is running out of 
energy. You'll be exhausted after the fight, which knocks even more down. I 
recommend having 3000+ energy before starting off.

  You'll have to fight trolls, then 3 waves of birds. Basically when they are 
a body length to the left/right, that's when you cast Jazzip. It seems that 
more powerful spells don't work any better, and Buzzap is ineffective. You 
have to aim a bit to hit the bad guys. Sometimes there are awkward pauses and 
start-ups. But there's nothing too damaging. Still, the gaps are so annoying 
you'll want to try to have everything you can fixed.

    10-3. NIGHTTIME AMBUSHES

  These are very nasty. You generally get about four waves of birds(dragon 
birds, barvils, illets,) all of the same number and arrangement. They enter 
from the right, go to the left edge, and go back. The birds are then 
recharged. You may get hit even when you're not under a bird, which adds to 
the annoyance. Bascially it's a lot like the gaps, where you fire only when a 
bird is near you. Since they are all in a row, you can often fire away once 
you hit the first one and knock out a few in a row. It's best to fire at guys 
going left. Then you can clean up when they come back right. Sometimes the 
whole round stops while the birds are coming back right, which sucks.

  A good way to avoid this is with Ud-Bar when night falls and it says "You 
are tired." You can't cast it during combat, though.

~-25 for not winning in Begonia
~-45 for not winning in Deloria
~-65 for not winning in Sumaria

    10-4. A COOL DOSBOX/EMULATOR CHEAT

  Combat in towns is frequently a hassle. It seems fleeing takes a while, and 
the actual fights can drain you. But if you have the emulator cranked up to a 
high enough speed, you can hold down the "F" button. This allows you to try 
flees continually. At regular speed the computer will only detect you hitting 
it once. Often you can flee without your opponent attacking, although you may 
have to try 20 times(i.e. hold the button down a bit.)

  You will want to slow the emulator down to beat monsters in the pass or at 
nighttime, but otherwise you can move pretty quickly between towns that have, 
say, lots of mushrooms or good pools on the path back and forth, but maybe 
they have tough monsters on each end.

  11. TRAVELIN'

  There are some simple tricks to use once you've gotten to level 2. Cast Ud-
Bar to go everywhere. It may use up some fatigue, but that's really not a big 
deal, especially with the prospect of dragon birds attacking at night over 
the longer treks. You should have enough cash by then(stocked up on silk and 
tea) to win comfortably. And if you don't, you can go back to Deloria and 
stock up on whatever you want.

  Traveling from one town to another and back isn't really symmetrical until 
Sumaria, when you'll need to skip anyway.

  In every town, when you leave, a beggar will be there. He always says the 
same thing and 10 gold should be enough to get him to show you what he wants, 
except in Sumaria(20.)

  When you leave a town, sometimes there will be a healing pool before any 
encounters. You can get that pool, maybe even 2, before a goblin fight. Then 
cast Ud-Bar. But you need to know in what order things appear. You can also 
cast Ud-Bar at night to avoid risking birds.

  12. WHAT MONKS SAY:

  Monks say something random based on which region they are in. I'm not sure 
what the chants are for, and some are just small talk, but some are very 
helpful.

  14. IF YOU MUST CHEAT...

  Hexadecimal editing is rather easy on the PC version. Say you have saved 
your character as "Biph."  Then you will edit the file Biph.sav. Below is 
what certain bytes do. Two-byte values have the low byte first. Maximum hit 
points/fatigue are oddly 9000 and not 9999(the usual.)

  You can teleport around towns if you are good with hex editors and thus 
avoid all combat nonsense, but Ud-Bar actually works pretty well. This is a 
good guide for if you get stuck without a Chewba in the last bit.

00-Sham is where you are at the start of the game. You can't go back--"Rowf 
dares not return so soon." 01-Sham is a duplicate location where you can go 
back in. So you could say one of these is a sham Sham.

  15. BUGS(?) INCL. PC VS. APPLE

--If you use a Yurpin, it doesn't show during on-the-road combat.
--You can get stuck in the tower if you don't know the words but have the 
elixir.
--The game was created on the Apple originally, and some of the PC data files 
in the port have a list of porting problems and suggested fixes.
--The Intersection on the Apple is referred to as the Crossroads in the PC 
version.
--N Shakamoz is referred to as E Shakamoz as well.
--Shimerr/S Shimerr are Shimerr Forest/Shimerr off the Apple.
--E Darizmag is referred to as the Batiniq Cliff when you are at the fight. 
There are a lot of these inconsistencies floating around.

  17. CREDITS

http://www.theunderdogs.org for the easier to analyze than the Apple Rings of 
Zilfin PC version. Their instruction manual was also very 
nice, although the one at...
http://www.dungeony.cz/seznam/ringsofzilfin.htm had *all* the information. 
Badly formatted. Worse than this FAQ's first version.
Thanks to the person from Hong Kong whose nice letter helped me take a look 
at this.

Quest for Clues by Shay Addams is responsible for that anonymous walkthrough 
floating around the net. Oh, wait, it IS the anonymous walkthrough floating 
around. Shame on someone or other!  Either way, the walkthrough inspired me 
to make something a little more polished, and some information was directly 
useful.
