This is the second Apple II release of Temple of Apshai that added an
animated intro of a knight beheading a giant ant, featured improved
graphics, and some sound effects. This release also offers two different
fonts (an "old English" and a standard one), and the controls are
sligthly different from the original. Instead of keys for turning left
and right, the game uses absolute directional keys instead.
