This is the Apple II version of the Wreck of Pandora game created by the
original designers at SPI for publication by Apple Co. It was never
released, as Apple decided not to publish games as part of their
marketing strategy.

The game is controlled by single letter commands like early
RPGs (for example the Ultima series or several games from Epyx).

To walk into one of eight direction you press the appropriate number key
as seen in the lower right on the screen.

The player has to stop an (alien) invasion on the space ship. To
accomplish this he may have to repair bots (R key + direction).

Several pieces of equipment, armour and weapons can be found on the
floor - you can pick these up with the G(et) command and L(ist) or
E(xamine) them.
