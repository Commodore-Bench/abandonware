Temple of Apshai is considered one of the first graphical role-playing
games for home computers, predating even the commercial release of
Richard Garriott's Akalabeth. It was an enormous success for its era,
selling 20,000 copies by the end of 1981, and 30,000 copies by 30 June
1982 and remaining a best-seller for at least four years.

Temple of Apshai is the first title in Dunjonquest, a series of
single-player, single-character fantasy role-playing games by Automated
Simulations (later known as Epyx). Temple of Apshai was the most
successful and most widely ported game in the series.
