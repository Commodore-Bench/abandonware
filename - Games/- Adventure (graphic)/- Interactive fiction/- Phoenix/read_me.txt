Phoenixâ€™s best known and best-selling games were the graphic adventures
Sherwood Forest, and Masquerade.

American Eagle became the new name of Phoenix Software after it was sold
in 1984. American Eagle continued to sell earlier Phoenix products but
never repackaged the software, instead covering Phoenix logos with
American Eagle labels.
