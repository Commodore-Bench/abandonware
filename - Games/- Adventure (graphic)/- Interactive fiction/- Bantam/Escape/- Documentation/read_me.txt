This is a collection of three mini-games loosely adapting the May, 1983
Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook number #20 of the same name. In that
book, the reader plays a secret agent underground in the nation of
Dorado, a fractured rump state of the former US southwest in the year
2035. The book concerns itself with escaping from this totalitarian
state and returning to democratic Turtalia; the game covers similar
territory with less hyperfiction and more primitive driving and flight
simulators, following traversal of a 3D maze representing town streets
accessed after a jailbreak. With the player are three fellow travelers:
Matt, resistance leader Zoey, and codebreaker Fred -- one of whom is a
traitor.
