1. LOADING THE PROGRAM
======================
   Dreadnoughts is an auto-boot diskette.  Place the game disk in Drive 1 with
the label side face up and power up the computer.  The game will begin.

2. INTRODUCTION
===============
   Dreadnoughts recreates World War II naval combat in the North Atlantic.
These were the last days of the great battleships, when Germany and Great
Britain fought for control of the North Atlantic and the important supply
convoy of the North Atlantic and the important supply convoy routes from
America.

   One of the more crucial naval actions of World War II involved Germany's
greatest ship against the power of the Royal Navy.  On 22 May 1941, the
battleship Bismarck and the cruiser Prinz Eugen slipped quietly from their
moorings in the early predawn hours.  Their orders:break through the cordon
of Royal Navy vessels and attack the North Atlantic convoys.

   In addition to the Bismarck scenario, Dreadnoughts provides a battle game
where players can build their fleet from a roster of 44 American, British,
French and German ships, and engage them in tactical combat.

3. SET UP
=========
   The title screen will present two choices DREADNOUGHTS is the Bismarck
scenario.  The BATTLE PROGRAM is the two-player game in which players compose
their fleets and engage in combat.  (The Battle Program is also present within
the Bismarck scenario.  Whenever the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen come within visual
range of British ships, the computer will load the Battle Program to resolve
combat.)

   These instructions begin with a discussion of the Bismarck scenario.
Following that are the rules to the Battle Program, which is common to both
the Bismarck and Battle Program scenarios.

   If you select the Bismarck scenario, the computer will begin loading the
information, and play will start immediately thereafter.  If you select the
Battle Program scenario, the computer will show the set-up screen.  Both
players compose their fleets, drawing from the list of Allied and German ships.
Each side may contain from one to nine ships, with the maximum number in play
begin ten.  Each side may have any mix of German and Allied ships.

Historical Note: The Battle Program will begin with both sides within sight of
each other.  At this range, aircraft carriers were unable to launch their
planes.  There are no rules in the Battle Program for air combat.

   All of the set-up commands are self-explanatory.  Once you exit from the
set-up program, you will be asked for the formation of each side (if that side
contains three or more ships), and for the visual range in nautical miles
(one nautical mile: 2,000 yards).  The game sill determine sighting based on
this number.  You cannot fire on a ship that you cannot see.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

KEY:
 1    The nationality and ship type.

 2.   The number of inches of armor in each section of the ship.  The following
      sections of the ship are armored (with their abbreviations in parentheses)
      :belt, deck, (GUN) main gun turret, (CRWN) turret crown, (SEC) secondary
      mount, (C.T.) conning tower, (PLOT) plotting room, (MFC) main fire
      control, and (RUD) rudder.

3.    The name of the ship.

4a.   An overview of the ship, showing the number, type and range of fire for
      each gun.  A primary gun turret is always shown as a block of white.
      When a turret receives enough damage, an "X" will appear.  Jammed turrets
      will display a "J" instead of a number.  Jammed turrets can become
      unjammed during battle due to the efforts of the ship's crew; this is
      automatically handled by the computer.

      The main gun mounts are always identified as "A", "B", "C", from the bow
      to the center of the ship; and "X", "Y", "Z" from the center of the ship
      to the stern.  Thus, the Bismarck's four main gun turrets are called from
      bow to stern the "A" turret, "B" turret, "X" turret and "Y" turret.

4b.   The secondary gun mounts are drawn with lines protruding from them
      showing their field of fire.  One gun line drawn on the port or starboard
      side of the square indicates that the mount can aim the gun up to 45
      degrees to each side of that line.  If it faces the bow or stern,
      however, the mount can only move 45 degrees towards the side of the ship
      the mount is on.  (See the Dunkerque diagram for an example.)  Two lines
      facing the bow or stern means that the mount can move up to 45 degrees to
      each side of that line.  Secondary gun mounts are numbered beginning with
      the starboard gun closest to the bow.  The next gun will be the port gun
      closest to the bow, and the sequence continues from starboard to port.
      This means that in most cases (because some designs have odd secondary
      gun turrets) odd-numbered secondary turrets will be along the starboard
      side; even-numbered turrets on the port side.

5.    This is the size or bore of the main and secondary guns.

6.    This is the amount of damage the superstructure and hull can take.  All
      damage is calculated by the computer, taking into account the size of
      the shell and the thickness of the armor.  Damage is reflected in the
      number of "X" that appear on the superstructure and hull lines.  If a
      ship has no more superstructure, any future hits will damage the hull.

5. Bismarck SCENARIO
===================
   The historical scenario is played between the computer (commanding the Royal
Navy) and the player (commanding the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen).  The game
begins with the German naval units in the Norwegian port of Bergen and ends
when your ships are either sunk, or safe in a friendly port.

German Victory Conditions: The German player must enter the convoy routes,
locate and sink as many ships as possible, then return to a friendly port.
Victory points are calculated on the following basis: the length of the cruise,
the amount of permanent damage (speed and hull hits) done to German and Allied
ships, and the status of convoy WS.8  This convoy is vital to the British 8th
Army in North Africa.  The German player can lose points if it gets to North
Africa undamaged.

There are 11 levels of victory: a draw and a British or German marginal,
victory, decisive, major and total victories.

Identifying Convoys: Convoys can be spotted by the Bismarck on the Air Search
and the Visual/radar displays.  If the letter T appears, it is the troop
transport Britannic.  A cluster of dots represents supply convoys, with a
cluster of five dots the important convoy WS.8.  If a convoy is within visual
range, the Bismarck can enter the battle program to attack it.

Note: The Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen will travel together at all times.  Any
commands you make during the Strategic Phase will automatically apply to both
ships.

6. STRATEGIC PHASE
==================
   There are two phases to the Bismarck scenario: the strategic phase and the
battle phase.  The battle phase is exactly the same as in the Battle Program.
   The Bismarck scenario begins in the strategic phase with the Bismarck and the
Prinz Eugen in the Norwegian port of Bergen.  The box on the left side of the
screen will show the passage of time by turning black during night turns and
white during day turns.

6.A STRATEGIC COMMANDS
----------------------
1-9           Continue moving at the present course/heading for that many hours
              or until a key is pressed.  The computer will also stop the move
              when the ships encounter enemy ships, aircraft, or land.  Two
              beeps at any time means that you have detected Allied radar within
              30 nautical miles.  Allied radar range is 15 nautical miles.

(A)ir Search  Launch Arado float planes to search surrounding area*.

(B)attle      If within visual range of the enemy, you may decide to offer
              battle.  The program will also begin automatically if certain
              conditions are met.

(C)ourse      Enter up to three digits, from 0 to 360, to indicate the new
              course according to the diagram below:

                            0
                          \ | /
                      270 ----- 90
                          / | \
                           180

Note: Unlike the Battle Game, any number from 0 to 360 may be entered.

(E)ndurance   This is a very important display because it shows how far your
              ship can travel in nautical miles if it maintains a certain
              speed.  As your ships consume fuel, the distances will go down.
              The distances between two points being equal, a slow-moving ship
              will consume less fuel than a fast ship.

              The second part of the display is the distance and course heading
              needed to travel to a friendly port.  The heading does not take
              into account the presence of the Royal Navy, or of land masses
              like England.

              To end the game, the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen must enter one of
              these four ports: Bergen, Brest, Naziere or Ferrol.  (While Spain
              was not a member of the Axis, it was friendly to Germany.  Being
              located next to Axis-occupied France, it was doubtful that Franco
              would not have allowed the battleship to stay.)

(F)orward     Continue moving at the same speed and heading until a key is
              pressed, or the Bismarck encounters something.

(M)ap         Print the strategic map, including the ships' previous course.

(P)atrol      Patrol for enemy vessels.  The ships will patrol the immediate
              area, increasing their effective search radius.  They will
              continue to patrol for 1 to 9 hours, or until they find something
              (simply enter numbers 1 to 9, or F).  Hitting any other key will
              end the patrol, and the ships will resume their course and speed.

              If something is found, the screen will show the radar display
              with the locations of enemy ships.

(Q)uit        Ends the game, allowing you to save the game.  A DOS 3.3
              formatted disk is needed.

(R)outes      Shows the British convoy routes that the Bismarck has been sent to
              intercept.

(S)peed       Changes the speed of both German units.  The computer will accept
              any number, but the ships can travel to faster than the maximum
              speed of the Bismarck.

(V)isual      Prints the Bismarck's visual/radar display.  In the center is the
              Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen.  The limit of visual contact is
              shown by the dotted line; of radar by the solid line.  The limit
              of visual contact changes according to the time of day or night,
              and the prevailing weather conditions.

NOTES: * (A)ir search means that an Arado float plane will be launched.  The
         ship will slow down to launch it, the resume speed.  If the Bismarck
         is going too far, or if visibility is poor, the seaplane may lose its
         way.  It will be up to the player to decide if it is worth breaking
         radio silence to give the Bismarck's position to the plane.  (The
         Royal Navy had primitive radio direction finders, so it is a risk to
         reveal your position.)  Even then, the plane may be lost.

         If something is found, the screen will show the radar display with the
         location of enemy ships.  There is a chance of pilot error in the
         number and type of ships reported.  The Bismarck will automatically
         move at its present course and speed for one hour after this command
         is performed.

7. BATTLE PROGRAM
=================
   When the Battle Program is used, it will show a screen divided into three
parts: the map, the ship roster, and the ship status.

MAP: The dots in the Battle Program map indicates the center of each square.
The distance between each square depends upon the scale, located at the bottom
of the map.  As the ships move together or apart, the scale will change from
3,500 yards per square to 500 yards per square.  Below the scale is the
visibility in yards.  Ship collisions are impossible at any scale.

SHIP ROSTER: This contains a listing of each active ship in the scenario along
with its number code and present course.  Ships in the Battle Program travel in
one of eight compass headings:


                           360
                      315   /0  45
                          \ | /
                      270 ----- 90
                          / | \
                      225  180  135

The ship number is used to issue main and secondary target commands.

SHIP STATUS: The sequence of play in the Battle Program consists of issuing
orders to each ship in play.  The computer will go down the roster from 0 to
9 (if that many ships are playing) and ask the player to enter any number of
commands.

COURSE: The direction the ship is traveling.

SPEED: The maximum speed of the ship (in knots).

MAX MF (movement factors): Each ship uses movement factors (MF for short) to
express how far it can move in one turn.  By using the (M)aneuver command, the
player can order his ship to move up to its Maximum MF.  The MAX MF number does
not mean that the ship will travel that number of squares.

TARGETS: Most ships have two types of guns: main and secondary guns.  Use the
damage display to see where they are on each ship.  By using the (p)rimary and
(s)econdary commands, the ship is ordered to fire those guns at another ship.
The primary and secondary guns may fire at the same ship, different ships, or
no ships at all.

NOTE: As you give orders from ship to ship, you will see that the positions of
some ships will change a square or two.  Distances are measured in actual yards
from the perspective of the phasing ship, and the scale between squares will
change.

7.A TACTICAL COMMANDS
---------------------
   These are commands available to all ships in the Battle Program:

(M)aneuver    Each ship can move a certain number of movement points.  To use
              these points requires entering a string of numbers, L, and/or R.
              The number tells the ship to move that many movement points
              forward, L will move the ship 45 degrees forward and to the left;
              R will move the ship 45 degrees forward and to the right.

              Example: The maneuver command 2LL1R will move a ship two points
              ahead, turn to the left, turn left again, move one point ahead,
              then turn right.

(P)rimary     Assigns a target to the main guns.  Enter the number of the
              enemy ship you wish these guns to fire at.

(S)econdary   Assigns a target to the secondary guns.

(D)amage/
Status        Shows the damage display and status of the phasing ship.

(N)ext        Finishes the movement/combat turn of one ship, and goes on to
              the next ship.  You cannot go back and enter new orders for a
              ship once the (n)ext command is enterd.

7.B MOVEMENT AND COMBAT
-----------------------
   After all ships have completed the command phase, movement and combat are
handled by the computer.

MOVEMENT: The computer will redraw the map, placing the phasing ship in the
center of the map.  Its move will be calculated and carried out within the
limitations of its movement allowance.  The computer will automatically go to
the next ship, redraw the map, calculate its movement, and so forth until all
the ships have moved.

COMBAT: The computer calculates the effects of combat.  All you need to do is
strike any key whenever the cursor flashes.

   A typical combat screen looks like this:

(The first hit from the Bismarck had struck and penetrated the Gun Armor of A
Turret, completely destroying it, so instead of a clear block, a row of Xs
denoted that fact.  Secondary hits are scored on the Superstructure.  In this
case, the hit destroyed the #4 secondary gun mount, located in the center port
side of the Hood.  If the second shot had landed in the same place as the first
hit (Gun Armor, A Turret), the shot would have had no effect since the turret
cannot be destroyed any further.)

SPECIAL DAMAGE: In addition to damaging the armor and guns of a ship, there is
a chance that specific, vital areas of the ship may be hit.  This special
damage may cause additional harm to the armor, or deprive the ship of
additional functions:

Control Tower: a shell has destroyed the bridge.  Until the second-in-command
is able to assume command of the ship, the ship will ignore any maneuver
commands.

APPENDIX A
==========

THE BISMARCK CHRONOLOGY
-----------------------

18 May 1941: The Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen leave their berth at Gotenhafen
with orders to raid commerce in the Atlantic.  Admiral Lutjens in command.
They halt at Korsfjord, south of Bergen.

21 May: Spotted by British reconnaissance aircraft, cruisers are sent on patrol
to watch for the ships.  The Hood and the Prince of Wales leave Scapa Flow.
Vice Admiral Holland in command.  The search is concentrated north and south of
iceland.

22 May: The King George V, the Repulse, the Victorious and other ships go to
sea.  Commander of the Home Fleet, Admiral Tovey, is aboard the King George
V.

23 May: The Suffolk sights the German ship in the Denmark Strait west of
Iceland.  The Norfolk makes visual contact soon thereafter.  Using radar, they
shadow the ships and broadcast their location to the rest of the fleet.

24 May: Vice Admiral Holland intercepts the German ships and attacks.  The
Hood blows up five minutes later, hit by shells from both German ships.  Four
shells slam into the Prince of Wales, forcing her to break off the fight.  The
Bismarck is hit twice, causing a fuel leak that forces Lutjens to abandon his
sortie and head for Brest.  The German ships proceed south while the Prince of
Wales and the other two cruisers shadow.
   That evening, the Prinz Eugen is sent off to raid commerce.  During the
night, the Bismarck is attacked by aircraft from the Victorious, with little
effect.

25-26 May: The British lose contact with Bismarck, last seen southeast of the
southern tip of Greenland.  Vice Admiral Sommerville leaves Gibraltar to
intercept the ship on its return to France.  This British Force H consists of
the Renown, Ark Royal and two cruisers.

26 May: Bismarck sighted again by a Coastal Command flying-boat.  That evening
,planes from the Ark Royal score a hit on the starboard rudder.  Further
torpedo attacks take place during the night, with no effect.

27 May: Tovey arrives with the King George V and Rodney and two cruisers.  The
Bismarck is badly hit early on and, after 90 minutes, she is dead in the water.
Several torpedoes hit, and the crew scuttles her.

1 June: the Prinz Eugen develops engine trouble and returns to Brest.

THE SHIPS OF DREADNOUGHTS
-------------------------
   The ships listed below are available for play.  The gun listing on the first
line is a ship's primary and secondary guns.  Some ships may have only primary
or secondary guns.  The numbers in parentheses are gun ranges in thousands of
yards (K YDS).  The armor is listed in inches.

GERMAN SHIPS
------------

BISMARCK
++++++++
   Germany's enforced hiatus in battleship design forced it to rely upon the
old Baden class ships when it designed ad built the Tirpitz class.  This meant,
among other defects, that the rudder and steering gear were badly protected.
This proved to be a fatal flaw.
   On her 1941 commerce-raiding run code-named "Exercise Rhine." the Bismarck
and the Prinz Eugen succeeded in destroying the Hood on 24 May and severely
damaging the Prince of Wales (see "Appendix A: The Bismarck Chronology").  They
escaped during the night, but were sighted on the 26th by a Coastal Command
flying boat.  That evening, torpedo-bombers from the Ark Royal scored two hits,
one on her starboard rudder, making the Bismarck uncontrollable.  The next day,
the King George V, the Rodney and two destroyers attacked.  Within '90 minutes,
she was sent to the bottom, destroyed in the end by torpedoes from the
Dorsetshire and her crews' scuttling-charges.

TIRPITZ
+++++++
   Built along the same lines as the Bismarck, she had greater power and range,
and more anti-aircraft guns.  Along with the rest of the German North Sea
Combat Group (consisting of the cruisers Scheer, Lutzow and Hipper), their
presence forced the disbanding of convoy PQ17, which was bound for the Soviet
Union.  Although they did not participate in the action, the scattering of the
convoy opened it to U-boat attacks, with the result that two-thirds of the
convoy's cargo was sunk.  While berthed in Norwegian waters, her crew
camouflaged the ship from air observation by laying newly-cut trees across her
decks.  Nevertheless, British bombers attacked her at Tromso and caused her to
capsize on 12 November 1944.  As a result, the other German heavy surface units
were transferred to the Baltic for the rest of 1944, leaving the U-boats and
the Luftwaffe to attack the convoys.

ADMIRAL SCHEER
++++++++++++++
   Named for the 1916 German Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Reinhardt Scheer,
this Deutschland class ship was among the first "pocket battleships" built
within the limitations of the 1919 Versailles Treaty.  For their role as
commerce raiders, these ships emphasized armament and endurance.  During the
war, numerous modifications were made to the Scheer, including additional
anti-aircraft guns.
   During the war, she participated in the scattering of convoy PQ17, and was
also a successful commerce raider.  Late in the war, she was transferred to the
Baltic Sea and with the Lutzow and Hipper to give off-shore support to the
Germany army.  She was sunk by the RAF in Kiel in April 1945.

SCHARNHORST
+++++++++++
   Both the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were intended to be the fourth and fifth
ships in the Deutschland class, but the construction of the Dunkerque class
ships called for a larger ship.  It took serious wrangling between the Navy and
Hitler for the ship to get its three triple 11-inch guns.  The Scharnhorst made
her appearance in Icelandic waters two months after Hitler invaded Poland,
sinking the British auxiliary cruiser Rawalpindi with the assistance of the
Gneisenau.  She supported the Narvik landings in 1940, suffering a torpedo hit
while attacking the British evacuation fleet.  During that battle, she was
attacked by 15 aircraft from the Ark Royal, which failed at the cost of 8
aircraft.  Berthed in Brest, she executed (with Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen) the
daring "Channel dash" from Brest to Wilhelmshaven under the eyes of British
forces (11-13 February 1942).  During October 1940 to March 1941, with the
Gneisenau and Hipper, they caught 49 ships (271,000 tons) in the North
Atlantic.  It was not until the "Battle of the North Cape" (26 Dec. 1943) that
the Scharnhorst was sunk by British ships.

  Secondary:  2

Engines and Speed: 160,000 h.p.; 32 knots


GNEISENAU
+++++++++
   Throughout the war, Gneisenau was under constant attack from the British
forces.  During a heavy air raid at Kiel, her bows were almost destroyed,
requiring reconstruction.  But the war deprived her of recovery, and she was
towed to Gotenhafen and sunk as a blockship in March 1945.

KOLN
++++
   One of a series of undistinguished light cruisers, she helped cover the
landing of German troops in Bergen, Norway.  Too light to be much of a threat,
the Koln was sunk at her moorings in 1945 in Wilhelmshaven.

GRAF ZEPPELIN
+++++++++++++
   Launched in 1938, the ship was 90% complete when Hitler ordered suspension
of construction.  On April 25, 1945 the ship was scuttled in shallow water.  The
Russians refloated the Zeppelin in 1947 but found it uneconomical to repair the
ship and accordingly scrapped the carrier in 1948.

PRINZ EUGEN
+++++++++++
   One of the more famous cruisers, due to her famous escort Bismarck.  She
joined the Scharnhorst in the "Channel dash" of 11-13 February 1942.  Later,
she was sent into action in the Baltic with the Scheer and Hipper, where she
survived the war.  In 25 July 1946, the United States used her (along with
90 ships), to test underwater atomic detonation at Bikini Atoll.

ADMIRAL HIPPER
++++++++++++++
   A convoy raider of the same class as the Prinz Eugen, the Hipper
participated in the Norway attack with the Scharnhorst.  Sent into the convoy
battle off Cape St. Vincent, she attacked two convoys and, with the help of
U-boats and the Luftwaffe, sunk more than seven ships (8-11 February 1941).
After participating in the scattering of convoy PQ17, she was sent to the
Baltic, where she was sunk.

ALLIED SHIPS
============
   All ships are British except where identified otherwise in the title.  Ex:
NORTH CAROLINA (U.S.A.)


HOOD
++++
   Britain's reply to the German arms race during World War I was to build the
biggest, strongest, fastest ship in the world.  Built in response to the
Germany's projected 15-inch battlecruiser, the plans for the Hood were revised
in the aftermath of the Battle of Jutland to give her greater armor protection
making her comparable to the Queen Elizabeth class rather than battlecruisers.
She was almost not built, since the Germans abandoned their building program
in 1917.  Of the four ships planned, the Hood was the ship farthest along in
the construction process, so she was completed and the others cancelled.  There
was a movement in the late 30s to add more guns and increase her armor against
aircraft along the Renown lines, but the war stopped that plan, and she was
immediately put into service.
   On 3 July 1940, she participated in the Battle of Mers el-Kebir (Oran) in
which British Force H attacked the French fleet before they could be handed
over to the Germans.  On 24 May 1941, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Holland,
she and the Prince of Wales attacked the Bismarck in Denmark Strait.  Five
minutes into the battle, the Hood blew up, when a shell hit her magazine.
While it is believed that she may have had thin armoring, part of the fault
may have been that her gunpowder detonators were unprotected.

KING GEORGE V
+++++++++++++
   By 1937, the terms of the 1930 naval agreements had been abrogated by most
of Britain's enemies.  The naval arms race was on, with the major powers
building larger and more powerful ships.  The King George V class, consisting
of five battleships with ten 14-inch guns, was in keeping with the agreements.
But with war fast approaching.  Britain has no time to upgrade them.  Compared
to the Nelson class, they were balanced and handsome ships.  There were some
changes in this design, including more armor.  There was also room for a
Walrus spotting plane and launcher that could be taken down when needed to
make space for light anti-aircraft guns.
   The King George V was launched in December 1940, in time to meet the
Bismarck's last sortie in May 1941.

RODNEY
++++++
   The Rodney might best be described as the "missing link" between the
dreadnoughts that sailed with the Grand Fleet in the First World War, and the
battleships that fought in the second.
   The Nelson and the Rodney were built to meet the requirements of the
Washington Conference of 1921, in which Britain could build two 35,000 ton
battleships with sixteen-inch guns.  With a lot of aluminum and light fire-
proofed woods, these two ships also had powerful guns that could match anything
found in European waters, but were hampered by their slow 21 knot movement.
   The Rodney was hit by a bomb in 1940, but was otherwise untouched.
Accompanied by the King George V, she aided in sinking the German battleship
Bismarck.

Engines and Speed: 43,000 h.p.; 21 knots



REPULSE
+++++++
   After their commission in 1916, the battlecruisers Repulse and Renown went
through so many refits by 1939 that they were known as Refit and Repair.  Their
birth was auspicious, being the first two battlecruisers commissioned after
Jutland (where three of Britains' nine battlecruisers went to the bottom).
   But when WWII began, Refit and Repair were two very different ships.  The
Repulse benefited from a better armor-belt, and in 1934, was given a catapult
seaplane and extra anti-aircraft guns.  Sent with the Prince of Wales to the
Far East, she arrived only to be sunk by the Japanese Air Force.

PRINCE OF WALES
+++++++++++++++
   Another of the King George V class ships, the sudden coming of war forced
her to be sent out with the dockyard "maties" still aboard.  She was badly
mauled by the Bismarck and sent back for repairs.  The rest of her career
included carrying Churchill to meet Roosevelt in July 1941 for the Atlantic
Charter Conference, and in November joining the Repulse to the Far East.  Their
mission was to defend Malaya in the event of a Japanese attack, but reached
Singapore after war had been declared.  With the Repulse and 4 destroyers
under Rear Admiral Philips, they tried to attack a Japanese force off Kuantan,
Japanese torpedo-bombers from Saigon sunk both ships as they returned to
Singapore.

REVENGE
+++++++
   The last class to have 6-inch secondary armament on the main deck, and the
only one of its class to be completed in time for Jutland.  But while ships in
the Queen Elizabeth class were being refitted and rebuilt to keep up with
developments, the Revenge class became increasingly obsolete.

NELSON
++++++
   Like the Rodney, the Nelson was built within the limits set by the
Washington Conference of 1921.  Equipped with powerful 16-inch guns, she was
hampered by her slow speed, and restricted mostly to convoy duty.  The Nelson
survived the war, being damaged only by two mines and a torpedo.

RAMILLIES
+++++++++
   Part of the Revenge class of ships.  Built for the last war, the only
modifications possible under the press for time was to add as many anti-
aircraft guns as deck space would allow, and hope that the Germans didn't find
them first.  She was torpedoed and sunk while supporting the Allied landings
on Madagascar.

RENOWN
++++++
   As a result of its 1936 refitting, several important additions were made
including extra anti-torpedo bulges, more boats, and additional anti-aircraft
guns.  Her actions included a brief, in-decisive brush with the Scharnhorst
during the Norwegian campaign.  From 1940-41, she was the Flagship of Force H
in Gibraltar, fought the Italian Fleet and bombarded Genoa.  Reassigned to the
Far East in 1944, she bombarded Sebang and Car Nicobar.

ARK ROYAL
+++++++++
   The Royal Navy's first ship to be launched as an aircraft carrier was
designed first as a cargo vessel.  Her long flight-deck jutting squarely over
bow and stern set the standard for future carrier designs.  Her sixteen 4.5-
inch guns were high up beside the flight deck, giving her an excellent field
of fire.
   Her battle record was enhanced in two cases by rumor.  In the early years
of the war, the Germans embarrassed themselves at different times by announcing
that they had sunk the carrier.  Then, while patrolling for the Admiral Graf
Spee, news reached her that the ship had been driven into Montevideo.  It was
the news of the Ark Royal's coming, and its exaggerated power fed secretly to
the Germans, that convinced the captain to scuttle the German cruiser.
   She attacked the Scharnhorst on 13 June 1940 with 15 aircraft, but failed to
damage it.  In July, she was part of a task force that attacked the French navy
in Oran.  She also contributed to the sinking of the Bismarck in May 1941.
Swordfish from the Ark Royal, launched in appalling weather, were able to find
and torpedo the Bismarck's rudder, jamming it so that the battleships could
catch up and sink her.  On 13 November 1941, the Ark Royal was torpedoed off
Gibraltar by U-boat U81 and sank 14 hours later.  Apparently, poor damage
control was the reason.

EAGLE
+++++
   Originally laid down as a Chilean battleship, she was revised as a light
aircraft carrier, spending most of her career in the Mediterranean.  On 5 July
1940, she helped invade Tobruk harbor, sinking an Italian destroyer and
freighter.  On 11 November 1940, Swordfish torpedo-bombers attacked the Italian
fleet from the carriers Illustrious and the Eagle.  Three Italian battleships
were sunk at their moorings.  On 11-13 August 1942, she joined the "Pedestal"
convoy to relieve Malta, where she was sunk by the Germans.

VICTORIOUS
++++++++++
   As part of the Illustrious class of ships, these aircraft carriers were
similar to the Ark Royal but had one less deck.  While most of these ships saw
service mostly in the Far East, the Victorious served in the Atlantic.  She
joined the fleet in time to help sink the Bismarck, slowing her with a hit from
her Swordfish torpedo bomber.  On 3 April 1944, barracuda dive-bombers from the
Victorious and Furious severely damaged the Tirpitz.  After the war, the
Victorious was stripped down almost to her keel and rebuilt to handle the newer
jets.  She was finally retired in 1968.

MANCHESTER
++++++++++
   In reply to the 6-inch cruisers displaying 15 guns in five triple turrets,
the British developed the eight ships of the Southampton class, each carrying
twelve 6-inch guns.  The Manchester was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian motor-
torpedo-boat in 1942.

SHEFFIELD
+++++++++
   Of all the ships in the Southampton class the Sheffield had the most
impressive career.  In addition to taking part in the sinkings of the Bismarck
and Scharnhorst, she was in the Barents Sea action of New Year's Day, 1942.
While providing coverage to one end of convoy J.W.51B, it was attacked at the
other end by the Lutzow, the Hipper, and several destroyers.  In a remarkable
display of seamanship, the local escort held off their stronger opponents for
three hours until the Sheffield and the other cruisers arrived.  After a three
hours until the Sheffield and the other cruisers arrived.  After a three-hour
battle, the Germans withdrew, leaving one destroyer behind and the Hipper
damaged.  The British lost the destroyer Achates and the minesweeper Bramble.
Hitler was so angry he ordered the remaining big ships in his navy to be
dismantled, though this was later rescinded.  The German head of naval
operations.  Grand-Admiral Raeder, resigned over the affair.  The Sheffield
survived to be the last of her class, scrapped in 1969.

KENYA
+++++
   The Colony class of ships were completed between 1940 and 1943.  There were
eleven ships in all, and the growing preoccupation with anti-aircraft defense
caused the suppression of turrets in these ships to put in more anti-aircraft
guns.  Both the Kenya and Nigeria were damaged by torpedoes during the
"Pedestal" convoy run to Malta in August 1942.  Only two ships from this class
were lost during the war, both to German aircraft.

EXETER
++++++
   Along with the York, the Exeter was one of smaller versions of the County
class.  Several modifications were made to its guns and hull, which were
cheaper but made them move vulnerable to enemy fire.  Both were lost during the
war, and the Exeter saw quite a bit of action.  She was one of three cruisers
that chased the Admiral Graf Spee into Montevideo and was engaged by that ship
(13 December 1939).  She was considerably battered, but continued to fight
until nearly sunk.  She was then assigned to the Far East theatre in 1942, and
was sunk later that same year in the Java Sea while part of a Anglo-Dutch-US
squadron.

NORTH CAROLINA (U.S.A.)
+++++++++++++++++++++++
   One of two battleships in this class that saw extensive service during the
war, mostly in the Pacific.  Designed under the London Treaty limitations of
1936, some changes were made when the Japanese rejected the treaty, by
replacing the four 14-inch guns with three 16-inch guns.  While it reduced the
speed by two knots, her protection against 14-inch shells was increased.

DUNKERQUE (Fr.)
+++++++++++++++
   The direct French response to the German Deutschland class ships were the two
ships Dunkerque and Strasbourg.  Unlike other battlecruisers, all of their main
guns were mounted forward, and were far less in size than what the treaties
permitted.  This allowed the magazine protection to be concentrated, saving
considerable weight, but increased the chance of the guns being disabled with
one hit.  Her career was far less notable than her design, being attacked twice
by the British to keep her out of German hands.  Although damaged at Oran, she
was finally scuttled in 1942 by the French in Toulon.

designers have put into the game system.  This applies especially to the
Bismarck scenario.  While we will not give the game away by citing specific
examples, rest assured that the British player (i.e. the computer) will be
fully prepared to meet almost any plan you can come up with.  This game has
been designed to recreate the historical situation the captain of the Bismarck
faced in 1941.
   There are, however, some hints and explanations that could help you in your
initial cruises.  Let's begin with an examination of the Bismarck.
   The first thing you'll notice about the Bismarck is its armor and power.
Checking her against the ships in Appendix B will reveal very few rivals.  The
fact that she can blow most cruisers out of the water with a blast from her
15-inch guns makes her a feared adversary.  And there will be times in the heat
of battle where you will wonder if anything can bring her down.
   That is precisely the wrong attitude to have, because there is no ship in
the game (the bismarck included) that can withstand the relentless pounding of
shells forever.  A shell exploding in the wrong place can do considerable
damage.  This is especially true when you realize that once a ship's super-
structure has been destroyed, any further hits on the superstructure will count
as hull hits!  There is also a good chance of a single shell doing serious
damage to the control tower (forcing a turn of inactivity while the new captain
takes over), the rudder (causing the ship to turn in only one direction) or the
hull.
   The Bismarck's strengths lie with her speed and armor.  Note that if she
takes too many hits that reduce her speed, she becomes an easier target to hit.
After that, it's just a matter of time before she gets sent to the bottom.  And
that's one secret about Dreadnoughts that's not mentioned in the rules: the
slower a ship moves, the better target she makes.  Since it's impossible for a
ship to be repaired within the time constraints of the game, any damage
incurred early in the cruise will haunt the player in later battles.  So the
lesson here is: be very cautious about committing the Bismarck to battle.
   Of course, there is one tactic that will help there, but we'll let you find
it yourself.

WHERE ARE THE CONVOYS?
   It may come to pass that, after playing a few games, you'll start wondering
where the convoys are.  Their initial placement may change from game to game,
but the one thing that is constant is that they'll always follow the convoy
routes (found by pressing the R key while looking at the strategic map).  But
they won't automatically appear and offer themselves to slaughter.  It's up to
you, the commander of the Bismarck, to search and destroy them.
   Here's how: once you get into the convoy lanes, you will find that the most
important commands will be air Search, Patrol, and Visual Display.  Just like
in real life, you will have to rely on your pilots and your radar operators to
seek out the enemy.  But they are not perfect by any means.  Radar technology
in the 1940's was not all it is in the 1980's.  Some ships had them, some
didn't.  Dreadnoughts also takes account of human errors, too.  If you send out
search planes on two consecutive turns, you may get two entirely different
reports.  Which should you believe?  There's no easy way to find out, and that
is exactly what the captain of the Bismarck faced.
   So, you're in the shipping lanes between England and America.  What should
you do next?  You have a number of options at hand.  A quick visual search will
reveal what you see with your eyes and what your radar operator reports.  Ships
within visual range will be identified by type (B for battleship, A for
aircraft carrier, and so on), while radar will only pick up blips indicating
that something is out there...maybe.
   Do you patrol or send out aircraft?  Both have strengths and weaknesses.
The bismarck cruising slowly in circles can cover three times its radar range
of 15 miles, while an Arado float plane can cover a 90 mile radius.  Both will
have some degree of human error in their reports.  Aircraft, however, can only
be launched in good weather to have a good chance of making it back.
   Sometimes you may have to reveal the Bismarck's position in order to guide
the float plane back.  This can happen when the plane is a) launched in foul
weather, or b) the Bismarck is traveling too fast for the plane to locate.
Revealing your position could be hazardous, for the British may be listening
in.  Of course, if you're being shadowed by British cruisers, it won't matter
a bit if you reveal your position.
   Even worse, you may reveal your position, but the plane still didn't make it
back.  C'est la guerre.
   If you successfully accomplish an air search or patrol, the screen will
display the results.  Convoys (consisting of merchant ships plus their
destroyer escorts) will be shown as a group of dashes.  The all-important
convoy WS.8 will have five dashes.  Also, the troop ship Britannic represented
by the letter T, may also make an appearance.  She counts as a convoy in the
victory conditions, too!
   Getting the Bismarck to attack the convoy could be difficult when you
realize that, while the float plane is in the air, the ship must carry out its
move for that turn.  If you work it right, the computer will load the battle
program and you're on your way!


BY FIRE AND STEEL
(Surviving the Battle Phase)

   You've done it now: the Prince of Wales and the Hood, along with four
destroyers, have intercepted and forced battle on you.  You're in the battle
phase, and you won't be able to escape until they're sunk or out of visual
range.  Can you escape?
   Oddly enough, chances are good of surviving the encounter.  We can't promise
that the Bismarck will emerge unscathed, but there are some rules to follow
that will increase your chances of winning the encounter.
   First and foremost, realize that the Hood and the Prince of Wales are not
two ships cut from the same mold.  Quite the contrary, there is twenty years
and two wars' difference between the two.  The battlecruiser Hood was built
during World War I while the Prince of Wales, commissioned in 1939, was a
member of the King George V class of battleships.  The advancements in ship
design makes the Prince of Wales a superior ship.
   The major difference between the two lies in their armor.  The Hood's
plotting room and conning tower are weaker than the battleship, as are her
secondary guns.  Plus, her fatal flaw that caused it to blow up (the un-
protected gunpowder detonators) has bee built into the computer program.  Thus
it's quite possible to recreate the historical outcome of the battle.
   So go after the Prince of Wales first, before the Bismarck suffers any
serious damage.  If you have the room and the patience, you could take
advantage of your superior reach and stay out of the battleship's main gun
range.  But it's hard to do, and especially difficult to maintain.
   One particularly effective tactic comes from the age of wooden ships and
iron men: that of "crossing the T."   The tactic requires turning your ship so
that her primary and secondary guns are bearing on the target's bow or stern.
With the tremendous firepower of the Bismarck, this can be devastatingly
effective.
   Assuming, then, that the Prince of Wales and the Hood are either sunk or
leaving the scene, what about the destroyers?  A pleasant surprise awaits you,
but we'll not go into that now.

The Fairey Swordfish torpedo-bomber dated from 1936, despite its antique look.
Although slow it had outstanding ruggedness and maneuverability and could fly
and operate from carriers in conditions which defeated more modern aircraft.
It established a record by remaining in production longer than any other Allied
plane in World War II, and proved ideal as an anti-submarine and anti-shipping
aircraft when armed with 60-lb rockets.
