the purpose of marketing Galactic Empire. Their sister, Cathy, joined
the company a year later.

Brøderbund is best known for the Apple II hits Choplifter, Lode Runner,
Karateka, and Prince of Persia, as well as The Print Shop—originally for
printing signs and banners on dot matrix printers—and Myst and
