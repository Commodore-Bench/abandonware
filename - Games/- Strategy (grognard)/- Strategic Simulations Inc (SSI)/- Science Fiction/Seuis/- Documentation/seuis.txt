INTRODUCTION
============
   SEUIS (Shoot 'Em Up in Space) or the Spacegamer's Tool Kit is both a new
game of war in space, and a toolkit for inventing your own scenarios, fleets,
and ships.
   SEUIS is a new episode in the military fantasy saga that began with THE
SHATTERED ALLIANCE, the tale of rivalry and valor fought on the planet of
Ozgorth in the days before modern weapons. SEUIS takes that story into the
24th Century, into the middle of an all-out war between high performance space
battlecruisers and fighters battling for dominance in the Universe.
   Using maps of different sectors of the Universe, and one of three different
scenarios, you must move each of your squadrons before the countdown clock runs
down to zero, trying to capture your enemy's star systems or defend your own.
When two opposing squardrons meet each other in space, the game switches to a
real time combat phase, where you must outmaneuver and outshoot your opponent's
ships.
   THE SPACEGAMER'S TOOL KIT lets you design your own cruisers and fighters,
assemble your own squadrons and fleets, and deploy them however you like on
your different star maps.  You can even speed up the game by shortening the
time limit on each turn.  Practically the only limit to your game is your
imagination.

1. SEUIS
========

1. STARTING THE GAME
====================
   Insert the game disc in your disc drive, and the game will automaticlly
begin.  If you have a Pascal system you must use your Basics disk.  Your screen
will display these choices:
     1. Play the INTROductory game
     2. Play a New Game
     3. Restart a SAVEd Game
     4. CREATE a Game
     5. Combat Practice
     6. Watch the Demonstration Game
     Which?
If you are ready to try the introductory game, press 1 and RETURN.
NOTE: You must always press RETURN after you type an entry, unless specifically
told otherwise.

2. INTRODUCTORY GAME
====================
   The scenario you are about to play is one of the three drawn from the
Chronicles of Ozgorth, parts of which appear in the back of this rule book.  A
large force of enemy ships attacks a friendly star system, and must be repelled.

3. THE ROSTER PHASE
===================
   First a fleet roster appears on your screen, looking like this:

                                 SC1R.FLT ROSTER
     #         ID        SYM       STATUS       CR         FT      PP
                                               ABC        DEF     COST
     8          1        |+|       ON MAP      000        104     104
     9          1        |+|       ON MAP      000        104     104
    10          2        |+|       ON MAP      000        050     110
    11          3        |+|       ON MAP      000        210     118
                          -
    12          5        |+|       ON MAP      011        120     166

   Let's look at each line:

SC1R.FLT ROSTER
   This is the roster of the first fleet that will battle in the scenario.
SC1R.FLT is the name of the fleet.  Sc1 tells you this fleet belongs to
Scenario 1; R tells you this fleet belongs to the Right, Green, or Ozgorthian
player.  Data about this fleet will always appear on the right side of the
screen.
   Next comes a list of the squadrons in this fleet,

                                  CR     FT    PP
   #    ID    SYM     STATUS     ABC    DEF   COST
   8     1    |+|     ON MAP     000    104    104

8 is the SQUADRON NUMBER.
   The ID number, or number of the prototype is 1.  This will be explained when
you start to build your own fleets.
   The SYMBOL of this squadron tells you that this is a Light Squadron.  These
are the symbols for the three types of squadrons:

|+|  Light Squadron
   Light squadrons are usually made up entirely or mostly of fighters, and are
the fastest moving squadrons.

 -
|+|  Medium Squadron
 -
   Medium squadrons usually contain at least one cruiser, and are slower than
light squadrons.

  |
-[ ]-  Heavy Squadron
   Heavy Squadrons with several cruisers, are slow but powerful.

STATUS
   "ON MAP" tells you that the squadron will appear on the map at the beginning
of the scenario.  In the third scenario some squadrons appear after the first
turn.  The Status will say GROUP 1 or GROUP 2 to tell you in what order these
squadrons will arrive.

                        CR
                       ABC
                       000

   This part of the roster tells you that this squadron has no cruisers.
   Cruisers are slower than fighters but much harder to destroy.  They are
traditionally classed in this way:
     Class A: Battleships
     Class B: Heavy battle-cruisers
     Class C: Light battle-cruisers

                        FT
                       DEF
                       104

   This part of the display tells you that your squadron has a total of five
fighters.  These are traditionally named this way:
     Class D: Destroyer Fighters
     Class E: Escort Fighters
     Class F: Light Fighters
        Destoryer Fighters are as powerful as many cruisers and faster, Light
     fighters are very fast but vulnerable.

                        PP
                       COST
                       104

   This part of the display tells you that your squadron cost 104 production
points to build.

PRODUCTION POINTS, ENERGY UNITS AND MIDSHIPS
   Each ship has a certain number of energy units and midships:
      ENERGY UNITS are needed to charge each ship's weapons and shields and to
      set its rate of fire before the combat phase.
      MIDSHIP UNITS measure the amount of damage that a ship can survive before
      it explodes.

   The total number of PRODUCTION POINTS of a squadron is calculated from the
   total number of energy units and midship units of all the ships in the
   squadron.  Production Points play two parts in this game:
      The production point total of a squadron sets its speed in the strategic
      movement phase.
      Since the number of production points is the cost of building a squadron,
      it decides how quickly more squadrons like it can be built by your
      Resource Centers.

   You are now ready to begin playing the introductory game.  Since the
   RAPIDFIRE system moves very quickly, you should understand the rules of
   movement and combat BEFORE you begin playing.  Read all the way through
   section 10 before you press RETURN to continue the game.

4. THE STAR MAP
===============
   A star map is a mpa of the sector of space where the battle will be fought.
There are several different types of star systems visible.

   /|\
  |-+-|  BRIGHT STARS
   \|/

   These large star systems contain two or more technologically advanced
planets with a high industrial capacity.  These planets are commercial and
economic centers which can produce additional starships.  Each bright star
system occupies the space of four single stars.

    |
   -O-   MAJOR STARS
    |

   Each of these systems contains one advanced planet with full starship
manufacturing capacity.

    O    MINOR STARS

   These system contain only pastoral or undeveloped civilizations, although
some planets have been colonized and can be used to build new ships.

    .    SINGLE STARS

   These star systems contain no inhabited planets.

    ...
   ...   SMALL STARS
    ...

   These areas of space contain dense concentrations of stars asteroids, and
the debris of exploded stars.

   All starships must reduce speed to navigate through sectors containing
bright, major, minor, and small stars.  They may move at normal speed through
sectors containing single stars.
   The starmap is a hexagonal grid with a single star in the center of each
hexagon.

5. MOVEMENT
===========
   SEUIS uses the new RAPIDFIRE movement technique first introduced in THE
SHATTERED ALLIANCE which allows you and in fact forces you to move quickly.
You move one squadron at a time and have only a limited time, measured bye the
countdown clock, to move that squadrons.  Your opponent or, if you are playing
against the computer, the artificial intelligence then moves one of its
squadrons.  The computer always tells you which squadron you may move.

5.1 Elapsed Time Units
----------------------
Underneath the star map, this display tells you how many time units have passed
since the game began:

                 E.T. = 0

When both players have moved all the ships they are able to move and any
production has taken place, a complete time unit has elapsed.

5.2 The Countdown Clock
-----------------------
Underneath the Elapsed Time display is the countdown clock.  Once play has
begun, you have until the clock reaches zero to give new orders to the squadron.
If you don't give the squadron new orders, it will proceed in the same direction
it was going.  You do not have to press the RETURN key after an entry when the
countdown clock is running.

5.3 Speed of Movement
---------------------
Here RAPIDFIRE is really revolutionary.  Each squadron moves only one sector at
a time, but some squadrons move more often than others.  Fortunately your
computer will keep track of who is supposed in move when for you.
   SQUADRONS WITH A TOTAL OF FEWER THAN 130 PRODUCTION POINTS MOVE ONCE EVERY
FOUR ELAPSED TIME UNITS
   SQUADRONS WITH A TOTAL OF 130-259 PRODUCTION POINTS MOVE ONCE EVERY SIX
ELAPSED TIME UNITS
   SQUADRONS WITH A TOTAL OF 260 OR MORE PRODUCTION POINTS MOVE ONCE EVERY
TWELVE ELAPSED TIME UNITS

   The three speed categories usually match Light, Medium and Heavy Squadrons.
(They don't have to, however, as you'll learn when you CREATE YOUR OWN GAMES
later.)
   So, although the squadrons appear to move equal distances, light squadrons
move half again as far in the same time as medium squadrons, and three times as
far as heavy squadrons.
   Note that a squadron that has lost ships from combat may speed up due to the
squadron's decreased production value.

5.4 The Squadron ID Display
---------------------------
   When it is time for a squadron to move, it will be highlighted, and a
display like this will appear on your side of the screen:

                              ---
                               +
                              ---
                              5 FT
                              0 CR

   This part of your diplay tells you that the highlighted squadron is a light
squadron with 5 fighters and no cruisers.  When it appears on your side of the
map, the countdown clock will begin running, and you have until the clock
reaches zero to move tha squadron.

5.5 Direction of Movement
-------------------------
   A compass appears on your side of the screen to help you choose your
direction of movement like this:

                          6     1
                       5     0     2
                          4     3

   To go up the screen and to the right (corresponding to Norhteast or 30
degrees on a terran compass), simply type 1.  To stay in one place, type zero.
To continue the course you were moving the previous move, simply press the
SPACE bar, RETURn, or do nothing at all.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PRESS RETURN AFTER AN ENTRY WHEN THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK IS
RUNNING.

   The number under the countdown clock tells you the course the squadron moved
the last turn.  If the number is 0, it was not moving at all.

5.6 Moving Through Star Systems
-------------------------------
   Your squadron will have to slow down to navigate through space occupied by
bright, major, minor and small stars.  If you enter one of these sectors, your
speed will be cut in half; that is, a light squadron will move only once every
eight elapsed time periods instead of every four; a medium squadron will move
once every  twelve periods instead of every six; and so on.
   When you move through space occupied by a single star, your ship can move at
normal speed.

5.7 Other Movement Rules
------------------------
   There are a few other simple rules of movement.
- You can't move off the map.  If you try, the computer will tell you,
  naturally, CAN'T EXIT MAP.
- You can't move more than one friendly squadron into one sector.  If you try,
  the computer will tell you, in the quaint terminology of pre-computer
  wargaming CANNOT STACK.
- When you move a squadron into a scetor occupied by an enemy squadron, combat
  will start automatically, and will continue until one or the other squadron
  is destroyed completely.

   If you are playing against the computer, the countdown clock will not run
during its turn.  Instead, the display will warn you, either THINKING or
PLANNING.  PLANNING means the Artificial Intelligence is giving all of its
squadrons the most current strategy for the scenario.  THINKING means the
Artificial Intelligence is deciding the orders for one squadron.

5.8 Accumulated Production Points
---------------------------------
   Your current Production Point value is displayed just above the movement
compass.

6. CAPTURING ENEMY STAR SYSTEMS
===============================
   Enemy star systems are a diffeent color than yours.  As your ship moves into
an enemy sector, it becomes yours.  When you leave it, it will change color.

6.1 Capturing Enemy Resource Centers
------------------------------------
   Your squadron can capture an enemy Resource Center (a bright, major or minor
star) simply by moving onto it.  If the system is a Bright Star, you must
occupy the topmost of the four sectors the star occupies.
   If it is defended by an enemy squadron, you must of course, fight that
squadron first.  If you defeat the enemy, or if the center is undefended, those
resource centers will begin making new ships for you.

7. SPECIAL OPTIONS DURING COUNTDOWN
===================================
   Besides your course settings (0-6), there are three other possible entries
you can make while the countdown clock is running.
H HALT  This will stop the countdown clock.  To start it again, press RETURN.
        (You can only halt if the countdown clock is running.  If you are
        playing against the artificial intelligence, and the screen says
        THINKING or PLANNING, you must wait until it is your turn to halt the
        game.)
M MAP   Occasionally, for various reasons, the map may disappear or become
        difficult to read if this happens, just press M.  The map will reappear
        just as it was, in the correct place.
E END   Use this option to save the game for playing later.  (See SAVE A GAME)

8. PREPARING FOR COMBAT
=======================
   When your squadron has entered a sector occupied by an enemy squadron or the
enemy enters a sector you occupy, you must prepare each ship for combat.

8.1 The Energy Allocation Phase
-------------------------------
   Just before combat begins, you will see a display like this:

PURPLE PLAYER UP, GREEN PLAYER PLEASE TURN AWAY
   ID    TYPE    MS     TE     W     S     R
   1     FT/D    30     20     1     1     1
   2     FT/F    10     10     1     1     1
   3     FT/F    10     10     1     1     1
   4     FT/F    10     10     1     1     1
   5     FT/F    10     10     1     1     1
NO RETURN NEEDED
ALLOCATE ENERGY FOR SHIP #1
   Ship Number 1 is a Class D fighter, or Destroyer, it has 30 MS, or Midships,
which means it can take 30 damage factors before it explodes; and it has a
Total Energy (TE) of 20 energy units.  You must divide these among WEAPONS,
SHIELDS, and RATE OF FIRE.

WEAPONS
   Your ships are armed with two kinds of weapons: beam weapons and homing
missiles.  Your beam weapons are fired by your game paddle; your homing
missiles are fired automatically.  You can allocate all or part of each ship's
energy to its weapons.  Type any number up to nine.  In this example, you might
type 9.  You don't need to press RETURN.

SHIELDS
   Your electromagetic shields can deflect damage from enemy beam weapons and
homing missiles.  The more energy units you commit to your shields, the less
damage your ship will take from enemy hits.  Type any number, so that the total
does not exceed your total number of Energy Points.  In this example, you might
type 9.

RATE OF FIRE
   Finally, you can now set how rapidly you wish your ship to fire beam weapons
and homing missiles.  Allocate your remaining energy to Rate of Fire.  In this
example your display will now show:
   #    TYPE     MS    TE     W    S    R
   1    FT/D     30    20     9    9    2
The total of W, S and R MUST equal TE.

MAXIMUM ENERGY
   The Maximum for any system is nine energy units.

ALLOCATING ENERGY TO THE REST OF YOUR SQUADRON
   After you have allocated energy to your first ship, you will allocate energy
to the rest of your squadron's ships in the same way.  When you are finished,
hit any key.  If you are playing a human opponent, he will now allocate energy
to his ships.

8.2 Choosing a Champion
-----------------------
   Your display will now tell you:
CHOOSE PURPLE'S CHAMPION
   Ordinarily, combat is fought between individual ships.  Type the ID number
of the ship you wish to use first.  Your human opponent or the computer will
now choose his first ship.  Combat is now ready to start.

9. COMBAT
=========
   A large rectangle will appear on your screen, containing the ships that will
fight.  The ships will look like this:

                            .
                           . .
Purple Figher               o--
                           . .
                            .

                            .
                          .. ..
Purple Cruiser           .  O---
                          .. ..
                            .

                          ------
                          \
Green Fighter              ---
                          /
                          ------

                           ---
Green Cruiser             --+----
                           ---

   Have your paddle ready beacuse combat begins immediately.  The left player
uses paddle 0, the right player uses paddle 1.
   You STEER with the dial and FIRE your beam weapons with the button.

9.1 Maneuvering
---------------
   When your paddle is turned all the way COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, your ship will
move straight tip the screen.  As you move your paddle CLOCKWISE, your ship
will turn to the right, going from course 1 to course 8 as shown:

                          UP SCREEN

                             1

                        8   --    2
                          /    \
                      7  |      |    3
                          \    /
                        6   --    4

                             5

   When your paddle has been turned all the way CLOCKWISE, your ship will be
travelling on Course 8.
   to change course from Course 8 to Course 1, or to UP SCREEN, you must
quickly turn your paddle COUNTERCLOCKWISE AGAIN, to turn your ship through
course 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.  You cannot go directly from Course 8 to UP SCREEN.

HITTING THE BATTLEFIELD BOUNDARY
   If your ship hits the line surrounding the battlefield, it will careen back
at a course 180 degrees opposite to the course it was previously travelling,
and may be difficult to control.  The best way to avoid this is not to fly too
close to the Boundary Line.

SPEED OF COMBAT SHIPS
   Fighters move twice as fast as cruisers.

HYPERSPEED
   If you want to speed up the combat, simply press the SPACE bar.  Both ships
will immediately begin moving at Hyperspeed.  To return to normal speed, press
the SPACE bar again (with two players both must first agree to enter or exit
hyperspace; otherwise, it is illegal to push the space bar).
   If you are playing against the Artifical Intelligence at the Ace or Advanced
Level, combat will automatically be at hyperspeed.  Pressing the space bar will
have no effect.

9.2 Using Your Weapons
----------------------

                       BEAM WEAPONS

   Beam weapons have a longer range than homing missiles, but they must be
pointed directly at the enemy ship.  They are fired with the button at a
frequently set by the RATE OF FIRE.

                        \\\||///
                       \        /
                      -  --o->  -
                       /        \
                       / //||\\\
                           .
                           .
                           .
                           .

                           |
                          |+|

   When you press the button, a red light will come on under your Midships.
Remaining Bar on the right side of the screen.  If you try to fire again while
the light is on, you will hear a short beep from your speaker, but the weapon
will not fire.  Each time you try to fire, (for instance, if you are holding
down the button of your paddle in the hope that the enemy ship will pass in
front of you) you will hear these short beeps, but your weapon will have no
effect.

                       HOMING MISSILES

   Homing Missiles can hit an enemy ship within a wide are in front of you at a
limited range.  They fire automatically if enemy ships are within the are at a
frequency set by your rate of fire.

                      \\\||///                          /
                 \    \      /                         /
                  \   -  <-o - .....                  /
                   \  /      \      .                /

9.3 Battle Royal
----------------
   Although most battles are fought with one ship against one ship, it is also
possible to fight a Battle Royal with all the ships in a squadron involved.
This option will be offered when you choose a champlon.  Press A for All Ships,
and RETURN.  (You should not choose a Battle Royal when playing against the
computer.)
   It is not necessary for both players to have all their ships involved.  You
may wish to surprise your enemy by attacking his one ship with all of your
ships.
BATTLE ROYAL COST (loss of neutrals due to the breaking of the code of war)
   If you choose to fight a Battle Royal, you will have to pay in extra cost of
200 production points.  100 will be taken from your total, and 100 added to
your opponent's total (your total will never be reduced below 0).
If both players decide to commit all their ships, then neither side suffers a
penalty.

FIGHTING A BATTLE ROYAL
   One ship on each side will be boxed, like this:  +------+
                                                    | ---- |
                                                    | \    |
                                                    |  --  |
                                                    | /    |
                                                    | ---- |
                                                    +------+

   This is the ship that is currently being controlled by the game paddle.  All
the ships will move and all will fire homing missiles at the intervals set by
their rates of fire, but only the boxed ships may fire beam weapons.  You
conrol the boxed ship in the normal way, steering with the knob and firing with
the button of your paddle.

CHANGING THE CONTROLLED SHIP
   You use the keyboard to move the control box from ship to ship this way:
   The PURPLE PLAYER on the left uses the A or the S key to move the box from
ship to ship;
   The GREEN PLAYER on the right, uses the Left Arrow or Right Arrow to move
the box from ship to ship.

HYPERSPEED
   As with regular combat, you can accelerate all ships to hyperspeed simply by
pressing the SPACE bar.

9.4 Damage
----------
   The two colored bars on the right will show the number of remaining midships
of each ship.  If you are fighting a Battle Royal, the bars will show the
remaining midships of the controlled ship.  As each ship is damaged, the bar
will shrink.  When it disappears, your ship blows up.
   The number of enemy midships destroyed by your beam weapons is decided by
this formula;
   Energy allotted to your weapons less energy allotted to your enemy's Shields
plus 5 ((W-S)+5).  If this results in a value less than one, then no damage is
caused.
   The enemy midships destroyed by your homing missiles is decided by;
   Energy allotted to your Weapons less energy allotted to enemy Shields (W-S).
Homing Missiles cause a minimum of 1 midship damage per hit.

9.5 Victory
-----------
   In normal combat, when one ship has been destroyed, each player will be
asked to choose another champion.  The damage the surviving ship has suffered
will appear on its display as a reduced number of midships.  Battle will
continue until every ship on one side has been destroyed.  In Battle Royal, all
ships will fight until one side's ships are wiped out.
   The display will then return in the Strategic game, with the victorious
squadron occupying that sector of the star map.  Any midship damage will be
repaired before the next combat, but destroyed ships will not be replaced.
Ships which end a battle with less than 9MS will be scuttled (destroyed) 50% of
the time.  The victorious squadron will never have its last remaining ship
scuttled (i.e. there will always be at least one survivor from each battle).

9.6 Interrupting Combat
-----------------------
   If you want to temporarily stop the game in the middle of combat, just type
N.  To resume combat, type any other key.

10. Production
==============
   At the end of each elapsed turn, your Resource Centers will manufacture
production points.  If they manufacture enough points, new squadrons may appear
on your star map.  The type of squadron will be chosen at random from those
existing prototypes you have enough points to duplicate.  For instance, if your
resource centers have made a total of 200 production points, and your fleet
prototype shows squadron types costing 180, 120, and 250 points, you may receive
a new 180 point or a 120 point squadron that turn; but, if the computer tries
to build a 250 point squadron, you will receive no new squadron at all (The
production points will remain available for future production).  A buzzer will
sound if production is successful, and the new squadron will appear at a random
location on the star map, near one of your resource centers.
   If your resource centers are captured, they will no longer make ships for
you.  If you capture an enemy resource center, it will begin building ships for
you.

11. SELECT OPTIONS PHASE
========================
   When you want to begin a new game, you can select several options.

OPTION #
   1. THE SOUND IS ON
   2. PURPLE SHIP PLAYER: COMPUTER
   3. GREEN SHIP PLAYER: HUMAN

   2. CHANGE THE PURPLE PLAYER
   3. CHANGE THE GREEN PLAYER
   4. CHANGE THE COUNTDOWN TIME
   5. CHANGE THE SOLITAIRE LEVEL
   WHICH?

   The highlighted options are those that are currently in effect.  In the
introductory scenario, you are the Green player and the Purple player is the
computer.  In ordinary scenarios, you can choose to play either side, or play
against a human opponent.

SOUND
   If you wish to turn the sound effects off, or, if they are off, turn them on,
press 1 and RETURN.  The option will change on your screen.

PLAYERS
   To change the Purple Player from computer to human or back, press 2 and
RETURN
   To change the Green Player from computer to human or back, press 3 and
RETURN

COUNTDOWN TIME
   You can choose the number of seconds each player has to move each squadron.
Press 4 and RETURN, then enter a number of seconds from 7 to 59 followed by
RETURN.

SOLITAIRE LEVEL
   This option is only offered if one player is the computer.  Press 5, and the
level of difficulty will increase from BEGINNER to INTERMEDIATE.  Press 5
again, and the difficulty will increase to ADVANCED and finally to ACE.  Another
5 will return the difficulty to BEGINNER.

12. THE SCENARIOS
=================
   You can choose one of three scenarios, taken from the archives of the great
battles of Ozgorth, Portions of the Chronicles of Ozgorth, describing these
times, are found in the back of this manual.

12.1 Battle in the Plelades
---------------------------
   The Ozgorth Empire Included highly civilized planets grouped around the
Pleiades, in the constellation Taurus.  These planets were attacked by a fleet
from the Empire of Ormolu.
   The Green player takes the part of the Ozgorthian defenders of the Pleiades
. He must hold his five bright stars against a major invasion fleet, commanded
by the Purple, or Ormolan Player.  The Purple player must conquer all five
bright stars or destroy the enemy fleet within 144 elapsed turns.  (In this
scenario only the five bright stars and the one minor star (controlled by
Purple) in the upper center of the star map are functioning resource centers.
The other major and minor stars do not produce production points, and do not
count toward victory if captured.

12.2 The Great Battle
---------------------
   After the battle of the pleiades, Ormolu sent his grand battle fleet to
attack Ozgorth itself.  The military council of Ozgorth assembled the greatest
fleet ever in the history of the Empire.  Its fleet met the grand battle fleet
of Ormolu in the Dragon Star System, midway between the Ozgorth and Ormolan
boundary stars.  The battle was the largest ever seen in space between two
equal and skilled opponents.
   Purple plays the Ormolan commander, Green the Ozgorthian leader.  To win,
you must destroy your opponent's fleet or capture all of his resource star
systems.  There is no time limit to this scenario.

12.3 The Final (Maybe) Battle
-----------------------------
   After the Great Battle, the Ozgorth Empire pushed back the Ormolans,
attacking the major Ormolan star base in the Tyche System.  An Ozgorth fleet
was ordered to capture the star base.  The Purple or Ormolan commander, has
five squadrons and numerous resource centers at his disposal.  The Green or
Ozgorthian commander attacks with five squadrons at the beginning of the
scenario, and receives two groups of reinforcements later.  He must capture
all of the resource centers within 144 elapsed turns.

   Ormolan Squadron 4 is the Flagship Squadron.  It has only two ships and it
can travel as fast as a light squadron.  Ormolan Squadron 5 is the Imperial
Guard Squadron, the most powerful squadron in the game.

12.4 Time Limits
----------------
   The Battle in the Pleiades and Final Battle Scenarios have a time limit of
144 elapsed time units.  The Great Battle has no time limit.

12.5 Reinforcements
-------------------
   The third scenario calls for squadrons to arrive later in the scenario.
These ships appear on the fleet roster with the status GROUP 1 or GROUP 2.  All
squadrons in a group will arrive at the same time (although you won't know
exactly when), at random locations on the star map.

12.6 Victory Conditions
-----------------------
   The scenario will end when one of the three victory conditions has been met:
     1. All of one player's ships have been destroyed.
     2. One player has captured all of the resource centers.
     3. The time limit expires.  (this applies to Attack on the Pleiades and
        the Final Conflict: the Great Battle and any scenarios you create have
        no time limit.)  In this case the Ozgorthian fleet wins in scenario #1
        and the Ormolan fleet wins in scenario #3.

12.7 Ending the Game
--------------------
   If you wish to end the game before the scenario is over, press E.  The
Computer will ask if you wish to save, finish playing later, or terminate the
game.


13. SAVE A GAME
===============
   If you wish to save a game, press E to end the game and choose option #2.
   When you save a game, you'll remove the game disc from your disc drive, and
insert a scratch disc.  A scratch disc is simply a disc on which you can save
games, maps and fleets for later use.  You'll need it if you want to make
your own fleets and games.
   Before you change discs, the computer will ask:

     Do You Wish to Initialize a blank disc for saving SSI Games ?  If you've
     never used the disc with this game before, press Y for Yes.  The computer
     will format the disc for future use.

     If you've already initialized this disc for SSI use, press N for No.

   The computer will now instruct you to remove the Game Disk and put in the
scratch disc.
   As soon as the disc is inserted, you'll see a catalog of its contents, if
any.  The computer will then ask you to give the game a name.  The name can be
of any length.
   Once you've given the game a name and pressed RETURN, the computer will save
that game on your scratch disc.


14. RESTART A SAVED GAME
========================
   If you ask to restart a Saved Game, the computer will ask you to remove the
game disc from your disc drive, and insert the scratch disc.  It will then show
you the catalog of that disc and ask you for the name of the game you wish to
restart.  Type that name and press RETURN, and the computer will load that game
into its memory.  Then simply take out the scratch disc, insert the game disc,
and resume the game just where you left off.


15. WATCH A DEMONSTRATION GAME
==============================
   You can watch a game in which both sides are played by the computer.


16. COMBAT PRACTICE
===================
   You can go directly into the combat phase, maneuvering and firing against
enemy ships controlled by the computer.  You may choose both combatant ships
from different squadron rosters, and set a difficulty level from 1 to 4.


17. THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
===============================
   The computer is capable of playing either or both sides with four levels of
difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Ace).
   Strategic Movement Phase Intelligence has two levels; it plans and thinks.
During "Planning" the overall situation is assesed and squadrons are given
specific orders.  An order may be to attack the closest enemy unit.  During
"Thinking" the squadron carries out its specific orders.  It may calculate the
distances to each enemy squadron and move toward it.
   Combat Phase.  All ships make use of certain parameters to determine their
actions.  Beginners only fire when they've got a sure shot.  The Ace will fire
at a less certain target.  Besides these parameters the Advanced and Ace
players handle certain situations differently and always use the Hyperspeed
option.  (Designer's note: I rarely beat the Ace in even combat.)


II. MAKE A GAME
===============

THE SPACEGAMER'S TOOLKIT
------------------------
   Now you've come to one of the most useful parts of this game.  Once you have
played a few games with the standard scenarios, you may want to start changing
the fleets or deployments to create your own scenarios.  This is where THE
SPACEGAMER'S TOOLKIT comes in.
   The procedure for making new games may seem complicated, but it's desinged
to give you the most flexibility and the most room for creativity.  The best
way to learn it is by making a few simple modifications.  In one of the
existing scenarios.  Later, once you get used to the procedure, you can start
making more and more original games.
   Have a SCRATCH DISC ready.  This is simply a blank disc, on which you'll
store the ships, maps and fleets you'll use to put together your game.  You can
use the same disc to save games in progress.
   We'll begin by making two very simple modifications to the First Scenario:
     1. We want to change an Ormolan squadron from a medium sqaudron to a light
        squadron.
     2. We want to change the location of one of the Ozgorthian squadrons at
        the beginning of the scenario.
   We'll begin, as usual, with the first menu.  Press 4 for MAKE A GAME.
   You will be given these choices:

     0. Exit
     1. Save your CREATED game
     2. Choose a Map
     3. Make a Fleet
     4. Change Prototypes
     5. Deploy your Fleet
     Which?

   In this case, we want MAKE A FLEET, press 3 and RETURN.  We'll see a new
menu like this:

     0. Exit
     1. Create a NEW Fleet
     2. READ a Fleet from disc
     3. WRITE your Fleet to disc
     4. MODify your Fleet
   Before we can modify a fleet, we have to look at it: we want "READ a Fleet
from disc".  Press 2 and RETURN.
The computer will instruct:

   Please insert the Disc with the Fleet you wish to read on it.

   In this case, we want to look at a fleet that's part of one of the scenarios
, a fleet that's on the Game Disc.  This time we can just leave the Game Disc
in the disc drive.
   Later on, we'll be modifying new fleets that we've created.  In those cases,
we'll put the scratch disc in the drive.

   As soon as you hit RETURN, you'll see a catalog of the disc, and the
computer will ask:

   ENTER FLEET NAME

   For this example, we first want to see the Ormolan fleet from the first
scenario.  We look at the fleet rosters listed under 12.  Scenarios and find
out that this fleet is called:

   SC1L.FLT

We type this, followed by RETURN.

   Now we have this fleet in the computer, ready to modify.  Upon returning to
the Fleet Making Menu, press 4 for:

   MODify your Fleet
   You 'll now see the roster of fleet SC1LFLT:


   #     ID     SYMBOL     STATUS         CR     FT    PP

                                          ABC    DEF

   7      8     -O-        ON MAP         121    100   285


   In this example, we want to make squadron 4 a light squadron, like squadron
1.
   Type the number of the squadron you want to change in this case, 4 and
RETURN.
   Now pick up the left game paddle (paddle 0).  As you rotate the paddle, the
different squadron symbols will appear on your screen.  When you see the one
you want (in our example,  for light squadron with ID = 1), press the paddle
button.
   The roster will be reprinted to reflect the change you're just made.  Having
accomplished our goal, press 0 to exit this phase.
   Now you have to save your new fleet.  Press 3 for:
      WRITE your Fleet to Disc.

   The computer will instruct you to take out the game disc and insert your
scratch disc into the disc drive.  It will show you the catalog, and then ask
you to name your modified fleet.
   In this example, we'll call our modified fleet:

                       NEW-ORM.FLT

   Once we've typed this and pressed RETURN, the modified fleet will be
permanently stored on our scratch disc.

REDEPLOYING SQUADRONS
---------------------
   We wanted to make one more modification to our first scenario: to change the
deployment of the Ozgorth defense fleet, we start with the same steps we used
to modify the Ormolan fleet:

You begin at the: FLEET MAKING PHASE MENU

Press 2 for Read a Fleet from Disc

The Ozgorth fleet is on the Game Disk.  The rule book tells us its name is
SC1R.FLT.  We enter this, and RETURN.

The computer will say:

   FILE READ

when it's done.  Press RETURN.
   Now that we have the fleet, we need the map.  Press 0 to exit the FLEET
MAKING PHASE MENU.

Now you're at the: BUILD GAME PHASE MENU

Press 2 for Choose a Map, and RETURN.

You'll now have a new menu, like this:

   MAP SELECTION PHASE

You may:

   0. Exit
   1. READ a map from disc
   2. WRITE a map to disc
Which ?
In this case, we want to use the map from the first scenario, the map of the
Plciades.

Press 1 for READ a map and RETURN.

The computer will ask ENTER MAP # (1-6)
The first three maps belong to the first three scenarios.

   In this example, we want Map 1.  Enter this and RETURN.
   Now we have this map in the computer.  We have to save it on our scratch
disc.  This time we'll give the map the new name:

      NEW MAP

   Now we have a fleet and a map: we still have to put them together.  Press 0
to EXIT the map selection phase and return to the BUILD GAME MENU.
Choose 5 for:
   Deploy Your Fleet.
Your Screen will show you the map of the Plciades, the same map used in
Scenario One.  The ships of the Ozgorthian fleet will be shown on the map, just
as they appear at the beginning of the first scenario.  Squadron number 1 will
be highlighted.
   If you want to move the first squadron, press a number corresponding to the
directions on the movement phase compass like this:


                6      1
             5     0      2
                4      3

   Keep pressing until the squadron is where you want it at the beginning of
your game.  You don't need to type RETURN.  When it's in place, type 0.  The
next squadron will be highlighted.  When all the squadrons are where you want
them, press E.
   Now you can save the new deployment of the Ozgorthian fleet.  Beginning at
the BUILD GAME PHASE MENU:
Press 3 for WRITE your fleet to disc.
   Once more time, take out the Game Disc and put in the Scratch Disc.  Give
this fleet with its new deployment the name:
   NEW-OZ.FLT

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
-----------------------
   By this point you have all the parts of your new game on the scratch disc.
All you have to do is put them together.  To do this, go back to the:

BUILD GAME PHASE MENU
---------------------
   Press 1 for:
   Save your CREATED game.
Once again, the computer will ask you to take out the game disc and put in your
scratch disc.
Once you've seen the catalog, it will ask:

ENTER MAP NAME?
---------------
   We enter the name of our new map.  NEW MAP



NEW-ORM.FLT
ENTER GREEN (RIGHT) FLEET NAME ?

   We enter the name of our modified Osgorth fleet:

NEW-OZ.FLT
ENTER A NEW NAME FOR THIS SCENARIO ?

   We can call this new game, appropriately. NEWGAME.

PLAYING A NEW GAME

   All that's left now is to play our new game.

Start at the beginning menu, and choose:

   2. Play a New Game

The computer will ask:

   0. Play a game you've created
      Scenarios from the Short Story
   1. Battle in the Piciades
   2. The Great Battle
   3. The Final (Maybe) Battle

   Press 0 for Play a game you've created and press RETURN.  Then take out the
game disc, put in the scratch disc and give the computer the name of your new
game:

NEWGAME

   The game will be loaded, and you'll put your game disc back in.  The game
will start with the Fleet Rosters and then the Options Phase.

2. CHANGING SQUADRON PROTOTYPES
===============================
   You learned at the beginning of this section how to modify the squadrons in
the first scenario.  You can use the same procedure to modify the prototypes of
any squadron, so that you have different numbers of cruisers or fighters.
   To do this, start at the: FLEET MAKING PHASER MENU.
   Press 2 for READ A FLEET FROM DISC.

   Read any fleet from your game disc or from your scratch disc into the
computer's memory.
   Now go to the: BUILD GAME MENU
   Press 4 for Change Prototypes.
   Select 1 for Modify Squadron Prototypes.
   A display like this will appear on your screen, showing you the prototypes
in the fleet you recalled.

SQUADRON PROTOTYPE DEFINITIONS

    ID     SYMBOL      CR       FT      PF
                      ABC      DEF     COST

             |
     8      -O-       121      100      285

             |
     9      -O-       131      000      288


   You can change any of these squadron prototypes.
   To change the first squadron prototype, press 1 and RETURN.
   The cursor will move to 1.  Use the space bar to move the cursor to the
Squadron symbol.  Rotate game paddle 0 until the symbol you want appears, and
then push the button.
   To change the number of A type cruisers, press 1 again and use the space bar
to move the cursor to the 0 under A.  Turn the game paddle until the number
from 0 to 5 you want appears and push the button.
   There is only one limit:

NO SQUADRON MAY HAVE MORE THAN FIVE SHIPS

   In the same way, you can change each squadron prototype.  To change what you
have entered, simply hit that prototype number again.
   As you add ships, the production point total of the prototype will increase.
   Notice that you can create a light squadron made up of cruisers or a heavy
squadron with only one fighter in it, if you want to.  But remember that the
speed of a squadron is set by its production point total, not its symbol.
   To save your new fleet's prototypes, you should now WRITE your fleet to
disc, giving it a new name.

3. CHANGING CRUISER, FIGHTER AND PRODUCTION PROTOTYPES
======================================================
   You can modify the strength and cost of the ships themselves and of your
resource centers.
   First, go to the: BUILD GAME PHASE MENU.
   Press 3 for MAKE A FLEET, and RETURN.
   Next, select: 1, READ a fleet from disc.

   You can modify the prototypes of a fleet from one of the scenarios, or from
a fleet on your scratch disk.  Enter the name of the fleet, and load it into
your computer's memory.
   Now you're ready to change prototypes.
   Go back to the: BUILD GAME PHASE MENU
   and press CHANGE PROTOTYPES.
   Then, select: 2, Modify CR & FT & production
   You'll see a display something like this:

CRUISERS                               FIGHTERS
ID     TE    MS     COST               ID         TE      MS     COST
A      20    70      112               D          20      30      60
B      15    50       45               E          10      20      10
C      10    30       12               F          10      10       5

RESOURCE CENTERS
ID    SYM             PP      TP
G      .              10      40

       |
H     -O-             12      21
       |

       _
      / \
I    | + |            11      11
      \_/

   There are the current prototypes for that fleet.
   Suppose you wish to change the specifications for Class A Flag Battleships.
Press A.  The cursor will move to that class.

SETTING TOTAL ENERGY
--------------------
   TE is the Total Energy that the ship has to operate its weapons and shields
and to set its rate of fire.  Turn the knob on your paddle to display any
number up to 27, and then press the button.
   When you increase the total energy units, the production point cost of the
ship will increase.

SETTING MIDSHIPS
----------------
   MS, or Midships, is the survival ability of your ship, measured by the
number of hits it can take before it explodes.
   To set the midships for type A cruisers, type A and then press the SPACE bar
to move the cursor to MS.  Turn the game paddle until the desired number
appears, and then press the button.  Once again, as we increase the number of
midships, the production point cost of the ship will increase.
   If you want to change your B class cruiser prototype, press B and follow the
same procedure.

CHANGING RESOURCE CENTER PRODUCTION
-----------------------------------
   When you have changed all the ship prototypes you need, you can set the
production capacity of your resource centers.
   Press G.  The cursor will move to the line with the symbol for Minor Star
Systems.
   You can set the number of Production Points that each of this type of star
system can build.  Turn the knob on your paddle to display a number from 1 to
63, and then press the button.
   Press G again, and the space bar.  You can set the number of Time Points
that it takes that resource center to manufacture the number of Production
Points you have set.  For example, if you have decided to produce 50 production
units and set the TP at 10, that type of Resource Center can produce 50
production points every tenth turn.  (The game has a limit of 50 squadrons.)
   In the same way, you can set the production capacity of Bright star systems
and Major star systems.
   As you can see, it is possible to make a type F fighter more powerful than
a type A battleship, or a Minor star system more productive than a Major star
system, if you wish.  Kep in mind, however, that the more production points a
ship costs, the slower it will move, and the less frequently ships like it
will be built during your production phase.

PRODUCTION POINTS
-----------------
   To calculate the number of Production Points a ship costs use these
formulas:

   Cruisers = (4 x MS x TE x TE)/1000
   Fighters = (5 x MS x TE x TE)/1000

4. CREATE A NEW FLEET
=====================
   You can assemble to brand new fleet, if you like, from either old or new
prototypes squadrons.
   Go to the: FLEET MAKING PHASE MENU
   Press 1 for Create a NEW fleet.
   The computer will ask you how many squadrons you want in your new fleet.
You can enter any number from 1 to 15.
   Press 4 for Modify your fleet.
   The computer will now give you a roster of your new fleet.  On this roster,
every squadron will be a prototype 1 squadron.  Use the keyboard and paddle to
modify the squadrons and their status.
   To change the prototypes of the squadrons to the ones you want go to the:
BUILD GAME MENU.
and choose: CHANGE PROTOTYPES
   Follow the procedure described in the section on changing prototypes.
   When your new fleet is set up the way you want it got to the FLEET MAKING
PHASE MENU and select:
     5. Deploy a fleet
Follow the directions in 5, below and then
     3. Make a Fleet
to write your fleet to disc.

5. DEPLOY A NEW FLEET
=====================
   Whenever you make a new game, you need to plan the deployment of each fleet
at the beginning of the game.  To do this:
   Go to the: BUILD GAME PHASE MENU
   Select: 2, Choose a map.
   Next Choose: READ a map from disc.
   Select a map from the game disc.
   If the map is not already on the scratch disc, give it a name and enter it
onto the scratch disc.
   Now go to the FLEET MAKING PHASE MENU and select:
   READ a fleet from disc.
   Load the fleet you want to deploy from your scratch disc into the computer.
   Next, go to the BUILD GAME PHASE MENU and press:
     5. Deploy Your Fleet.
   The map you chose will appear on the screen.
   Your first squadron will appear in the upper left hand corner of the map.
Type a bearing from 1 to 6, as in the movement phase.  Each time you type a
key, that squadron will move one sector in the direction you indicated.
   When the squadron is in the place you want it to begin the scenario type 0.
The next squadron will appear.
   When all the squadrons are deployed, go back to the FLEET MAKING PHASE MENU
and WRITE your fleet to disc.

6. PLAYING A NEW GAME
=====================
   When you're ready to put together a new game, follow the steps outlined in
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:

     1. SAVE YOUR CREATED GAME
        - ENTER MAP NAME
        - ENTER NAME OF PURPLE (RIGHT) FLEET
        - ENTER NAME OF GREEN (LEFT) FLEET
        - ENTER NEW NAME FOR SCENARIO
     2. PLAY A GAME YOU'VE CREATED
        - ENTER NAME OF YOUR NEW SCENARIO

   And that's all there is to it.
Note that a fleet may be used by either side and is only assigned its "Purple/
Green" status during this phase, or both fleet names could be the same.  Games
which are designed by the players will end only when a condition in Section
12.6 is met, although players are encouraged to use their own victory
conditions.

7. SUMMARY OF THE SPACEGAMER'S TOOLKIT
======================================
1. To make a new game, you just have a scratch disc.  You cannot make a new
   game on the game disc.
2. To make a new fleet, either read a fleet from the game disc or from the
   scratch disc, and then modify it.  When you've modified it, save it under a
   new name on the scratch disc.
3. Once you have some fleets and maps on your scratch disc you can combine
   them into new games and save these complete games on your scratch disc.

FROM THE CHRONICLES OF OZGORTH
==============================
An except fromthe journal of Astra Calla, cadet in the Aerial Protection of the
Ozgorthian Empire; and daughter of Leander Dann, memeber of the ruling
triumvirate of the Empire.

                                                         - 19 Danedel 1863


   I don't trust what I see in the reflection panel, is my hair really that
dark of am I paler than usual ?  Those smudgas under my eyes can't be from
lack of sleep.  Sleep's all I have energy enough to do these cycles.  I told
the family Healer.  Findlay, that I know what the Lizardmen must have felt like
when they sickened and died out.
   I received the following lecture: "Astra Calia, I assure you, you have no
conception of the physical plight of the Lizardmen that led to their extinction
.  Their affliction was brought on by an inability to adapt to a changing world,
and the inability of Healers to help them.  None survived our Techno Era and
that was and romes ago."
   I'm not unsympathetic to creatures pas or present.  I'm embarrassed to say
it, but if you've got an infra-red scanner you can make out the letters on the
hull of my ship: SAVE THE UNICORNS.  I contribute about fifteen reachers an
andromede to help Ozgorth's dwindling herds.  Right now I'm the one who needs
saving.  I've felt this coming on for a long time.  I've been putting in long
cycles on orbit patrol which isn't one of my favorite duties as an enlistee in
the Aerial Protection of the Ozgorthian Empire (APOE).  I got to dizzy I had to
be towed home.  I received a two cycle remedy leave.  I've been to three
specialists already and the only thing each agrees on is that they don't know
what's wrong with me.  I would have to get the most exotic disease in the
sector.  Rare, of course, Cureable, of course not, Treatable ? Unknown.
Nobody, least of all me, knows what this means yet.  I'm not ready to bequeath
my fighter ship.  The Starwedge, to my little brother, Randall, at this time.
It's going with me on the inner dock of my older borther's cruiser.  Erandt's
taking me to the Remedy Resource Center on Meropia.
   I don't know what i'll do if they take away my flying privilege.  My family
has served in the Protection Corps of Ozgorth for generations.  We can trace
our Lineage back to Sea Champion Cadwallader before outer planet travel was a
reality.  I've got two older brothers in the APOE.  Erandt and Quentallis, and
my youngest brother has just started his training.
   My father of course needs no introduction.  He has just been elected to his
third term in the triumvirate of the Empire along with Elsinor llan (Elflord,
native of Ozgorth) and Max Madella (popular spokesman from Helio Minor).
   My father's postion was assured because he was and is the best general in
the Empire.  Elsinur llan's position was assured because he's Elven and a
direct-line descendant of early kings on Osgorth.  People love tradition and
ceremony.  Max was the surprise.  He usurped Idelia Brandon's place.  She's
an old family friend, but her views on fortifying home rather than exploration
and expansion are not popular these days.
   I'm looking forward to this trip, not just because I'll find out whether I'm
dying or not, but because it's one of the most beautiful places in the galaxy.


   The Sight was worth the price of admission.  The reflection nebulae that
nestle around Meropia really are one of the seven wonders of the galaxy!  Five
bright yound stars (yound as stars go) shine out blue from behind a veil of
fine dust.  The whole crew was at the viewing port held spellbound by the sight
of the diffuse blue glow, so nobody detected the Resource Center's first alarm.
   There are other Remedy Resource Centers in the galaxy, but none greater than
the one on Meropia.  She was the finest base for remedy research, storing
unhold amounts of knowledge, and now she was under attack.
   It was not pleasant to watch.  Erandt ordered full speed, and as soon as we
were in range, he launched the fighters.  The orbit patrols were the first to
be obliterated.   Planetary defense was slow to respond.  It reminded me of the
history relays I'd seen on our Early Space Wars era.  The only battles I'd
participated in previouly had been simulated ones.  It hit me hard that this
battle was real.
   The attacking ships were definitely not of this galaxy.  The design was
different.  The weaponry was similar.  they were using some sort of focused
energy.  Meropia and her protective ships were not the only targets.  Orbiting
outposts, research centers, even art stations were under fire.
   The enemy had a sizable fleet.  Besides fighters there were larger ships
reminiscent of our cruisers.  these were moving toward the resource centers.
We soon stopped receiving signals from Meropia.
   Erandt did two things before he launched his personal fighter: He gave
Sammer, his second-in-command, control of the cruiser and he forbade me to
leave the ship.
   I waited for word from our father.  I knew Meropia would have immediately
contacted the capital planet of Ozgorth where the triumvirate holds its seat.
My father, Leander Dann, was no doubt assessing the slaughter.  The enemy had
hit us hard and fast.  The bulk of their fleet was leisurely picking off our
meager reinforcements as they dribbled out.  Our ships were hemmed in between
blown out bases and attacking ships.
   I was stunned when my father ordered our cruiser out of range.  Sammer was
only too quick to obey so I had to break in.
   "Now wait just an andromite! Your son is out there.
   As-tra Cal-la..."  I heard my father bite out faintly over the relay system.
"You will carry out my orders and not try to circumvent them!"
   Daughters can take slightly more liberties with their fathers than sons can
so I stretched my luck, "Belay that last order.  At least let us pursue."
   The receiving system was switched off with a violent whine.  It was Sammer's
turn. "Astra Calla, I relieve you of your duties.  Please don't make me relieve
you of your rank as well."  Sammer and my brother were best friends.  They had
gone through training together and always signed on the same ships until my
brother got his own command.  I knew that standing Erandt must be tearing hime
apart.  He had always been more than tolerant of "Erandt's kid sister", but
now he was furious with me.
   The way I figure it, unless somebody has grey hair then authority is only
cursory as far as I'm concerned.
   "I'm launching Starwedge, Sammer... sir... even if I have to ram through the
hull trying."
   "Duty and rank!" The redness in his face subsided a bit and he added.
"There's nothing you can do.  Astra.  You'd be killed."
   I glared at him as if he had half the brains of a Zorg, an ancient,
primitive beast race of old Ozgorth.  "Do you remember why we came here in the
first place, Sammer ?  I'm probably going to die anyway!"  Now I didn't believe
this for an andromite, but Sammer did.  It worked.  He let me go.
   The view from the clear dorne of my Starwedge was breathtaking and quite
different from the walled veiwscreen of the cruiser.  There were no peripheral
obstacles between me and all that blue blackness of space and stars.
   My scanners gave a little squeak as something new filled my viewscreen: an
enemy ship.  I kept my relay system open, but no one made any attempt to
communicate.  I maneuvered out of their line of fire just at the crucial
instant.  I aimed my incendar beam, fired, and broke the record for quick
exits.  I was lucky.  There was no pursuit.  Dying in some remedy center with
a tube up one's nose isn't my idea of glamour, but then neither is being blown
to bits in deep space.
   I eased Starwedge around to where I'd last seen our squadron under fire
from on board the cruiser.  They were still out there.  As I got closer the
hits from each side registered as static on my relay system.  More and more
enemy ships kept appearing on my screen.  I began to see the wisdom in my
father's retreat.  We were outnumbered and had lost a section of our galaxy to
an unknown enemy!
   "... to Ozgorthian Startwedge 3.83 ... repeat ... You're in isolation ..."
   I couldn't trace the urgent male voice that came over the relay, but whoever
was hailing me was close enough to detect my call-numbers.  My rear scanners
began to pick up moving objects, not of this empire.
   "Three eighty-two, you've got company." came the matter of fact voice over
my relay system.  I was given an altitude and azimuth reading and I headed for
it, maximum speed.  I saw them then, two fighters that skimmed overhead and
began to fan out, executing a standard three ship attack maneuver.  I did my
part, a 180 degree backward loop, firing as I turned.  I hoped that the ships
flanking me were out of range.  It was a success.  The static that filled my
relay system had to clear before the fighters could break in.
   "... good flying Oh-82.  I thought we might cruise the outskirts and see
how many we can pick off the tail of they squadron.  Their cruisers have a lot
of shield capacity, but they're slow."
   I could see the two ships off my starboard side.  The cloest one's call
number was M, something obliterated 77.  The M meant a Meropian issued fighter,
but why the rest of the number had been altered or destroyed.  I couldn't
guess.  I put on a little more speed, trying to outdistance him so I could get
a reading on the other vessel.  I picked up a DZ and checked it against my
planetary listing Del Zur.  That craft was from a watery planet with very
little land mass.  No wonder they look to the skies.
   M?77 broke into my reverie.  "Say Oh-82, you're a long way from home.
What's an Ozgorthian fighter doing in this sector ?"
   "I'm beginning to wonder that myself," I answered as I eased up on my speed.
"We're all under orders to retreat."
   "Meropia has been taken over!  Other Resource Centers are being threatened.
I'm not running away.  I don't care if General Dann issued those orders
himself."
   "He did."
   "So ?  Report me," challenged the arrogant Meropian pilot.  The Del Zur
fighter was silent.
   I was picking up a faint relay on another frequency so I switched
communications.  "Here Sammer." I said as I boosted my signal.

   He was brief and to the point "I'm leaving this sector, Astra.  You're got
half an andromite to return to the cruiser.  We've sustained some damage.
Can't wait."
   This is where I get off."  I relayed to my companion fighter pilots.
   "Backing out on us!  Just what I'd expect from some shaking she goal of
a"
   I cut him off.  I know Meropia had an abundance of herd animals, but that
bit of knowledge gave me no comfort when compared to one.
   I headed back.  It was going to be close.  The enemy was massing fast.  It
wouldn't be long before they closed off this entire section of the galaxy.
Our fortification in these parts was nothing to brag about.
   When I was able to get a fix on the cruiser I also picked up several foreign
spacecraft between me and my destination.  Their hulls had been hammered out of
some purplish ore from an unknown world.  I'd never make it back to Ozgorth on
my own with the amount of fuel I had left.  And who knew how many fuel ports
had been taken over between here and home?  I set my automatic missile rate
and pleaded with Sammer to assist me.
   "We've got no power." Sammer apologized softly.  "All our energy had been
diverted to ourt shields."
   While I was cursing in three different languages I heard a maniacal yell
over the relay as a fighter veeered into view.  Another soon followed with a
distinctive DZ on its underside.  They were dodging in and out, drawing fire,
and keeping the other ships at bay.
   I saw an opening and I made for it.  The dock portal of the cruiser was
just ahead when I saw the Meropian fighter enveloped in the hot white light of
incendar fire.  I hesitated while I switched channels.  I picked up his
signal, an urgent "Go!"
   As soon as I was safely aboard the cruiser I ran to the communications
console.  I was feeling powerfully dizzy.  "M whatever 77 ...  Are you all
right ?"  I couldn't detect the ship's presence on the screen, but I was
getting an energy reading from the relay.
   Finally, "Not serious.  You got aboard safely?"  His tone was even, but his
voice was breathless.
   "Fine."  I shouted to be heard over the crackie of static.  My head was
pounding unmercifully.  "Who do I thank?"
   "... Stafford."
   "Fine, Stafford.  I'd like to thank you for"
   He answered with the best human rendition of a bleating goat that I'd heard
in a long time.  I must have fainted, because that's all I remember hearing
before waking up in the Cryogenics Center on Aldeberon.

                                                           4 Tanedel 1866


   "Astra Calla? Astra Calla, can you hear me?  You should be able to Auditory
functions manifest themselves before physical... or so theory states."
   "What the"  Did my lips form the words or was it just a thought? A rush of
fire in my extremities.  What is happening ?  Curiousity or hunger, it's hard
to gage which is the stronger.
   Findlay, the family Healer, seems nervous and excited.  It isn't every
cycle he gets to revive a patient who's been frozen for nearly three
andromedes.  " You've been internalizing food for two cycles.  Astra Calla.
No! No, don't try to sit up.  We're going to to take things slowly."
   "Don't say we when you mean me, Healer."
   "Our long sleep didn't improve our temperament."
   "Findlay!"
   "Your temperament, sorry."
   I scanned the uniformed figures in the room.  My family was not among them.
"Where's my father?  What's been happening ?  The attack on Meropia."
   "Later, when you're stronger."
   "I feel fine.  I have three andromedes of catching up to do!  I don't want
to remain ignorant of what's been going on for an andromite longer than I have
to!  Is there a console with a data bank?"
   "What do you want to know?"
   "What happened to Erandt?"
   "Missing, presumed dead."
   I had expected this, but that didn't make it any easier.  " Got any other
great news?"  I snapped.
   Findlay looked shaken.  "Later, on my word as a Healer later."
   I slept a lot for someone who had been doing little else for the past three
andromedes.  It was great to finally be able to consume solid food again and
to move around.  There were guards with me throughout all my waking and
sleeping moments.  Age, rank or bribes didn't matter.  Their coversation had a
narrow range from the climate of Aldeberon to my progress.
   I couldn't contain myself much longer.  I pounced on Findlay during his next
visit.  "I'm starved for news!  If you don't start talking I'm going to start
screaming, loud, and for a prolonged period of time!"
   "I would advise against that," said my father stepping through the archway
into the room.  Once the formalities of the father-daughter mansion had
subsided such as wild screaming, crying, hugging, and kissing.  I had a good
look at General Leander Dann.  The strain of being military commander of the
Ozgorthian Empire had taken its toll.  His hair was greyer, his face more
lined than I remembered.
   "What've you been doing that's so important that it had priority over
seeing your daughter?"  I demanded.
   "Two things: One Findlay ordered me not to upset you.  Healers outrank even
generals in matters of health." he replied with a glance at the departing
Healer.  "Two, I've got an upcoming battle on my hands."
   "Battle?  With who?"
   "The Ormolunes.  You were present at the time of their first invasion."
   "Ormolune ... Ormolune ..."  The name sounded vaguely familiar.  It conjured
up eerie foreboding feelings like a past crime resurfacing.
   "Let's review your knowledge of history.  Who was Ormolu ?"
   "Wasn't he a sorceror also known as Ormolu the Immortal?"
   "Correct.  He was an interstellar invader who was unsuccessful in his
attempt to take over ancient Ozgorth.  the sect called Moon-riders were other
travellers from the same galaxy who rebelled against him.  Their "magic"
became our science.  Much of our technology was modeled on these precepts."
   "That explains why our beam weaponry and ships are similar."
   My father nodded and continued.  "These invaders are from the distant
Dungar System.  Many of our probes have penetrated that region, but none ever
survived to transmit information back to us."
   "What happened after the attack on Meropia in the Pleiades System ?"
   "You missed the most important battle of my career...  Our fleets against
the Ormolunes.  You can monitor it on a history relay.  We've made studies of
their tactics from "The Big Battle."
   "What did they hope to gain ?"
   "Control of our rich Resource Centers."
   "Control the Centers, control the Empire."  I put in.
   "We've routed the Ormolunes from most of our galaxy, but we have our
suspicions that there is at least one more hold out.  An Ormolune robot ship
with a recorded message heading in the direction of this Resource Center was
intercepted.  It threw down the gauntlet so to speak.  It gave us the grandiose
option of dying in battle against the Ormolune flee from surrendering
immediately.
   I knew my father attached little meaning to the word surrender.  "What's
your strategy ?" I asked.
   "It's not clear just where or when the robot ship was to arrive.  We believe
we have an advantage this time.  We've calculated its source of origin and
traced the Ormolune craft to a nerby Resource Center.  Come with me."  He led
me to an adjoining room.  Projected on the far wall was an impressive computer
display showing possible combinations for the upcoming battle.  His fingers
flew over the terminal and I watched units move as he tapped the keyboard.
   The manufacturers call this model SEUIS.  It stands for Strategic Engagement
Ultrafast integrated Simulator, but around here we refer to it as Shoot 'Em
Up in Space.
   "Are you familiar with the famous Terran generals.  Alexander and Napoleon?"
he drilled me.
   I nodded and recalled to mind the ancient history of a planet in a
neighboring galaxy.
   "Alexander and Napoleon had only fifteen to twenty possible ways to conduct
their battles."  he informed me.  "My computer gives me thousands.  "He sighed
and muttered.  "I think Napoleon and Alexander were better off."
   "Do you plan all your battles on this machine?"
   "I always try my strategy against the computer to see how it defends
itself."
   "Who won this battle?"
   "I did."
   "Good."
   "No, that's bad." he explained.  "I was playing the Ormolunes.  The computer
was playing me."
   We were interrupted by a flashing light on the short range scanner panel.
   "There they go." my father siad, his eyes rivetted to the screen.  "Our
first squadron was just launched.  I'll need some good fighters in reserve.
Astra Calla.  How are you feeling?"
   "Great, Is the Starwedge here?"
   "Maintained in good repair and ready."
   "I feel even better!"
   "Are you certain?"  His eyes searched my face.  "Have you felt dizzy at all
lately?"
   I shook my head no.  "You mean I might not be cured?"
   "No cure has been tried.  Didn't Findlay tell you ..."  My expression
clearly revealed that he had not told me anything.  My father hesitated,
troubled as he punched some buttons on the console.  "Remember the robot ship
the Ormolunes sent with their Ultimatum?  We had no idea of its motive so we
designated all power to planetary defensive shields.  This caused a drain on
most other systems.  The equipment maintaining your temperature was non-
operational for awhile.  Findlay was going to put you under again, but all
tests indicate that you're in remission."
   He answered my next question before I could ask it.
   "There is no way of knowing for how long.  At the first sign of symptoms
returning you must seek out the nearest Cryogenics Center and be readmitted."
he stressed.
   "Didn't Findaly relay Terra for a cure?"
   "Andromedes ago.  Long distance communications are difficult with the
Ormolunes trying to monitor and disrupt our signals.  We can only hope that
one of our messages got through and a telluric cure arrives safely."
   An officer strode into the room.  "The grounded ormulune robot ship has
been fitted with a sub standard relay system.  General Dann.  The technicians
say she'll fly, but she hasn't been tested yet.  Shall I have Agent Moonrider
be on the ready?"
   "Proceed as planned."  My father remembered that I was in the room.  His
hand strayed absently from my hair to my shoulder.  "You'd better suit up.
Stand by for the next squadron."
   Neither one of us cared to explore the unpleasant aspect of our possible
defeat.  "Standard security rendezvous at the capital?"  I asked assuming that
we'd both live through this cycle.
   He nodded and left, his mind totally focused on his mission.
   I gasped involuntarily as I passed the small screen the officer was engaged
at.  The image I caught before the screen went dark was an insert from a file
labeled: MEROPIAN PILOT STAFFORD.
   "Sorry, Astra Calla." apologized the officer.  "Restricted information."
   I waved this off with a shrug as I backed out of the room.  My memory had
been jarred.
   I suited up, checked on my beloved Starwedge, and reported to squadron
commander Chamberlain.  There were still several andromites before our
departure so I sought out a portable data bank.
   Besides universal affairs, it was interesting catching up on who had
achieved what rank and who had married among my friends.  And then there was a
certain Pilot Stafford who had been expelled from APOE on various charges
including misuse of uniform, violation of direct orders, and profiteering.
With the amount of reaches that  the price on his handsome head equalled.  I
could almost buy myself a new fighter.
   The visual relay showed Pilot A.  L. Stafford's intense dark eyes under
unruly hair of the same color.  He looked no older than my eldest brother,
Quentallis.  Something just didn't feel right.  Here was a person who had
risked his life for the Ozgorthian Empire just three andromedes ago.  There
was another file on Stafford that I couldn't get access to without the proper
code.
   I gave up when I heard the signal for my unit and headed for my ship.

   Once more among the stars as I headed toward the bright star where the
Ormolune fleet lay it was as though I'd never left.  I cleared my relay system
and picked up Commander Chamberlain's voice.
   "hadson, you're our champion."
   Good choice, I though as I watched Hadson's fighter break formation in
pursuit of an enemy ship.  He was a veteran of the civil uprising on Garrity
five - make that eight - andromedes ago.  all modesty aside.  I'm not that
had myself.  Then again, no one in my squadron would have lived through a
season if they weren't good.
   I noticed an awkward enemy fighter that was having trouble maneuvering.
It couldn't ease itself clear of its line in time and actually hit several of
its own ships.  the Ormolunes turned on their own ship and fired.  Damaged, it
soared out of range.  I kept my eye on it.  The Ormolune fighter was heading
steadily away from the battle.
   I flipped open my relay switch to commander Chamberlain's channel.  "Shall
I pursue?  It may be going to warn others."
   I never heard a reply, I cringed at the blast of the enemy's full force
direct hit that sent twisted fragments of our commander's ship somersaulting
into view.  With a surge of anger I raced after the single fleeing Ormolune
craft.
   I had just passed Seline and Seult, the moons of Stacer, when I had a brief
dizzy spell.  It passed quickly and I was gaining on the Ormolune ship so I
ignored it.  I adjusted my homing missile rate as the enemy ship spiraled into
Stacer's orbit.
   I had stopped on Stacer once for provisions.  this planet was a bustling
mercantile dream.  It was one of the most populous planets in the system.  If
the enemy craft managed to make a landing its pilot just might be able to lose
himself in a crowd.  As i feared, the Ormolune ship headed for the deserted
sand lands of Stacer.
   The pilot did some impressive maneuvering, but not enough to evade all of
my missiles.  Crippled, the vessel was going to have rough landing.  I followed
it down, the Ormolune craft seemed to be fighting against itself all the way.
   I saw the nose of the fighter ploughing through the ground like a burrowing
animal whose tail is on fire.  I landed and made my way through the haze of
setting sand that billowed up from the force of impact.  I had the eerie
feeling that I was being watched as I approached the wreckage.  This side of
the planet was uninhabitable.  the sand lands of Stacer were a sharp contrast
to its teaming cities.
   The noise of something metallic falling from the wreck caused me to draw
my hand incendar from its hoister.
   "Hail."
   Startled, I fired.  I squinted through the drifting sand cloud and made my
way cautiously toward the sound of coughing.  No one could have survived this
crash I told myself.  But there he was, disheveled and dirty, yet I recognized
the face from the data bank I had viewed.  The uniform was torn, but I could
see the Ormolune insignia it bore.
   Stafford nursed his left arm, "Easy with that thing." he managed to gasp.
"I didn't survive that landing just to be blasted at again."
   I shook my head increduiously.  "You shouldn't have lived through that."
   "My sole purpose in surviving was so that we could finally meet face to
face, Astra Calla."
   "How do you know who."
   "Your face has been on every relay system in the galaxy.  You're a public
figure.  Your father runs the Empire."
   "My Empire, Stafford."  I corrected him.
   "You remembered my name.  How kind," he smiled.
   "Stop joking." I snapped, furious that he had put me in the position of his
captor.  I had the traitorous desire of not wanting to turn him in, "I have
to take you into custody."
   "do you hear me protesting?" He smiled his maddening smile again.
   "My ship is a one seater but I can convert it."  I told him as I motioned
him over.
   He limped a little as he walked.  "Cozy." he remarked.
   "I'm taking you to Stacer's Directorial."
   "You can't do that, Astra.  I'm a high criminal.  You've got to take me to
Ozgorth."
   "The Directorial can take you to the capital."
   "Afraid to make the trip alone with me?"
   "Get in."
   We rode in silence until I broke out of Stacer's orbit.
   "Changed your mind, eh?"  Stafford wondered.
   I was pondering my next move as I fingered my relay controls.  "All right!"
I screamed at him. "Why did you go over to the enemy ?  Why ?"
   He looked out the dome.  "I didn't I'm your bodyguard ...  Astra, are you
all right?  You're very pale."
   For the first time I noticed that my hands were trembling at the controls.
"I don't know ..."
   Stafford reached across and lent a hand with the instruments.  "Why don't
we change places?  let me fly this thing.  You can keep an incendar trained
on me."
   I agreed feebly.  I could picture my arrival on Ozgorth.  I hoped the visual
relay crews were busy elsewhere.  There's nothing like an ultradimensional view
of one's image throwing up projected throughout the galaxy.  The incendar in
my hand shook.
   "Steady." Stafford said.
   "I'd make a great hostage."  I pointed out, "If I take you to Ozgorth
they'll execute you as a traitor."
   "Your duty permits you no other choice."  Stafford replied as we continued
towards Ozgorth.

   "Then he's not a traitor?"  My relief was obvious and my father smiled.
   "Putting a price on his head was the only sure way we had of getting him
safely into our hands.  Presently he's helping to settle Noneva Minor."
   My father's joy was unmistakable.  "We've won, Astra Calla.  All is quiet
in the direction of the Dungar System."
   "I'd still watch that sector."  I advised him.
   "With great care."  My father winked.
   "And you say Stafford's on Noneva Minor?"
   I know what I'm going to do next.  I'm going to find Stafford.  He's got a
lot of explaining to do.
