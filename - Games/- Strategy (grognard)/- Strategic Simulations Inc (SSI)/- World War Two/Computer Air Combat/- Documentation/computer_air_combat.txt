1.0 Introduction 
        Computer Air Combat is a simulation of aerial warfare during World War
        II. Players have the option of flying American, British, German or
        Japanese aircraft in a variety of different air combat missions. Each
        of the different aircraft types will maneuver, attack and absorb
        damage in the game according to how it actually performed in combat.
        These rules are intended to introduce you to basic concepts necessary
        to play the game. They do not provide details of the extensive
        mathematical formulas and data used to simulate aircraft performance
        or determine the outcome of attacks. These details are left for each
        player to discover as he plays the game, just as a new fighter pilot
        often had to "learn the hard way" by climbing into the cockpit and
        taking off to engage the enemy. If you are playing this game for the
        first time, it is recommended that you read the rules up through
        section 8, then play along with the instructional flight example
        presented in section 9. After that, you're ready to solo.

2.2 Game Units
        Horizontal distances and attitudes are measured in kilofeet (1000
        feet, abbreviated kft). Distances are displayed to the nearest tenth
        of a kilofoot (100 feet); altitudes are displayed to the nearest
        hundredth of a kilofoot (10 feet). Speed is displayed in miles per
        hour (mph), rounded to the nearest 10 mph. Each game turn represents
        approximately seven seconds of real time. The precise value was
        selected so that in one turn the distance move a in kilofeet is equal
        to speed in miles per hour divided by 100. For example, an aircraft
        traveling 250 mph will move 2.5 kft per turn.

2.3 Passwords
        At the start of each two player game both players will be required to
        enter a password of one to five characters. It is important that each
        player keep his password to himself. This will ensure that secret
        information held by the computer is revealed only to the appropriate
        player.

2.4 Saving a Game
        A game in progress may be saved at the start of any move or combat
        phase for either player. Saving a game allows you to resume a game
        from the point at which play was suspended. The option of saving a
        game before any move or combat phase permits playing a game by
        correspondence. Saving a game is accomplished through the use of the
        (Q)uit command described in section 4.8.

2.5  Talking to the Computer
        The computer will prompt you for whatever information is needed. These
        prompts will usually take the form of asking you to answer a question,
        enter a number, or select a command from a menu of options. After
        responding to each information request from the computer, complete
        your response by pressing the (return) key. To correct a mistake, use
        the (left arrow) key to backspace, then type over the mistake. Most
        inputs require only a single letter, except for the 2 letter movement
        commands described in section 5. Yes or No replies are entered by
        typing the single letter (Y) or (N). If the first letter of a possible
        response is enclosed in parentheses, it means that only that single
        letter should be entered; examples are the general commands described
        in section 4. In a few instances you may only have to press the
        (return) key. This technique is used either to select a "default"
        value, such as a resume program execution after pausing to permit
        viewing of displayed data.

3.0  Sequence of Play 
        Computer Air Combat is played in a series of game turns until all
        aircraft on one side are destroyed, or the engagement is terminated by
        mutual agreement.  Each game turn consists of a standard sequence of
        phases.

3.1  Scenario Selection and Set-up Phase (Start Of Game Only)
        At the start of a game both players decide which scenario they want to
        play (see the Game Selection Card), the number and type of aircraft
        each player will control, and the starting location, scenario and
        options selected. Some of these starting conditions may be chosen
        randomly by the computer.

3.2 First Player Movement Phase
        The first player secretly moves all of his aircraft.  Before moving
        any aircraft, he may request aircraft position or status reports, or a
        global position plot.

3.3 Second Player Movement Phase
        The second player, or the computer in solitaire scenarios, secretly
        moves all of his aircraft Player 2 may also check position or status
        reports, or examine a global position plot before beginning movement.
        Any information on aircraft locations provided to Player 2 at this
        time will be as of the start of the turn; the results of Player 1 's
        movement this turn is not made available to Player 2.

3.4 Second Player Combat Phase
        The second player may now check the positions of all aircraft visible
        to him, and initiate combat against any enemy aircraft which are
        within range. All positions shown at this time are those resulting
        from movement during the present turn. Before initiating combat, he
        again has the option of examining position or status reports, or plots
        of aircraft locations.

3.5  First Player Combat Phase
        The first player enters his password and checks for possible combat
        opportunities for his aircraft, in the same manner as the second
        player.

3.6 Combat Results Phase
        The effects of any attacks conducted during the preceding combat
        phases are determined, and damage recorded. The computer checks to see
        if all aircraft on either side have been shot down, thus ending the
        game. If not, the next turn begins with the First Player movement
        phase.

4.0  General Commands
        At the beginning of each movement and combat phase there are several
        commands available to the player. These commands are described in this
        section and summarized on the Game Information Card.

4.1 Position Report (P)
        Displays the position, course, speed, and bank and nose attitude of
        all friendly aircraft and all visible enemy aircraft. In the Night
        Fighter scenario, if no enemy aircraft are visible, a radar contact
        report on the currently assigned target will be given.

4.2 Status Report (S)
        Provides information on the amount of damage an aircraft has taken and
        on the amount of ammunition remaining. Damage categories and their
        interpretation are:

        None No damage
        Hit Less than 50%
        Major Between 50% and 75% damage
        Critical Greater than 75% damage
        Out       Engine disabled (Multi-engine aircraft only)

Ammunition supplies refer to number of attacks remaining for forward-firing 
guns only (turret guns do not run out of ammunition). Separate totals are 
shown for cannon and machine gun ammunition.

4.3 Global Plot (G)
        Plots all friendly and all visible enemy aircraft on an 80 kilofeet by
        140 kilofeet display. The plot is initially centered on X = 0, Y = 0),
        but you have the option to re-center the global display on any point
        in the XY-plane. The X-axis and Y-axis are indicated on the plot,
        except when no longer present due to re-centering. When not centered
        at the origin, the global plot center is indicated by a small cross.
        The global plot is always oriented with north toward the top. Friendly
        aircraft are displayed as an open-centered rectangle; hostile aircraft
        as a solid square. Course, speed, altitude, etc., on all visible
        aircraft are available through the (P)osition command described in
        section 4.1.  If present, the direction of the sun will be indicated
        by a solid color rectangle on the W, SW, S, SE, or E edge of the plot.

4.4 Movement (M)
        The movement command permits you to move all friendly aircraft as
        described in section 5.0.

4.5 Tactical Plot (T)
        Plots all aircraft visible in the immediate vicinity of a single
        friendly aircraft. This is the same plot which is shown when moving an
        aircraft except that positions are shown at the completion of all
        movement. This command is normally used to decide whether or not to
        initiate combat by seeing if there are  any enemy aircraft which can
        be attacked. A firing arc is plotted in front of your aircraft to aid
        in determining whether there are any aircraft in position to be
        attacked by your forward-firing guns. The tactical plot is
        aircraft-centered, and the top of the display is always in the
        direction of aircraft heading. A small window in the lower right hand
        corner displays the compass heading of the display orientation, e.g.,
        N, NW. The tactical plot extends 6 kft ahead, 2 kft behind, and 7 kft
        to the sides of the center aircraft.  The length of each firing arc
        symbol is 2.5 kft, The size of the aircraft symbols is not to scale;
        the length of The size of the aircraft symbols is not to scale; the
        length of each symbol is 0.45 kft, about 10 times the length of a WWII
        fighter.  Symbols for aircraft which are within 0.45 kft each other
        horizontally may overlap; however, collisions only occur when aircraft
        end a turn within .03 kft of each other. All friendly and visible
        hostile aircraft located within this 8 x 14 kft region are displayed
        oriented relative to the aircraft whose tactical plot is being
        presented. Aircraft outside this region can be plotted using the
        global plot described in the previous section. Friendly aircraft are
        indicated by a white identification stripe just forward of the tail.
        Hostile aircraft are a solid color and do not have this identification
        stripe. The bank attitude of each aircraft is visually indicated on
        the display. The following symbols are used to show the different bank
        attitudes:

(See Illustration)

        Note that the three inverted attitudes are all indicated by a "white
        stripe" painted on the lower surface of each wing. The  tactical plot
        perspective is always looking down from above on an aircraft
        regardless of relative altitudes. You will notice a size increase in
        symbols plotted at a relative angle of 45, 135, 225 or 315 degrees;
        this distortion is introduced by the Apple hi-res graphics. The
        following are the symbols used for V-1's, bombers in level flight, and
        air race pylons:

(See Illustration.)

        Bombers in level flight are shown with engine nacelles on the wings
        for ease of separating bombers from fighters, even though there are
        single-engined bombers and twin-engined fighters in the games. An
        (ID)entification option is available on the tactical plot to provide
        identity, course, speed, altitude, etc., on each aircraft displayed;
        this option is described in more detail in section 5.

4.6 Combat (C)
        Checks all friendly aircraft to determine if there are any enemy
        aircraft which are subject to attack. You will be informed of each
        possible attack in order, and given the range, target aspect and type
        of guns available.  You will then be asked if you want to make an
        attack or not. If you answer yes, the attack will be conducted and you
        will be informed whether or not your attack scored any hits. Each type
        of gun may only attack one target per turn.

4.7  Unload Aircraft (U)
        Aircraft can begin the game loaded with either bombs or auxiliary fuel
        tanks. Loaded aircraft have degraded climb and dive rates,
        maneuverability, etc. At the start of each movement phase, you can use
        the (U)nload command to drop whatever load the aircraft is carrying
        and thereby improve your aircraft's performance (but with a possible
        penalty in victory conditions).

4.8 Quit (Q)
        Suspends play of the game and asks if you want to save the current
        game conditions. After saving a game you are given the option of
        resuming play. If you do not save the game or resume play then the
        final results of the game will be displayed. It should be noted that
        the (Q)uit command is not shown on the command menus which are
        displayed. This command always may be given whenever the other command
        options in this rules section are available.

5.0 Moving Your Aircraft
        Aircraft movement is controlled by maneuver commands which affect
        aircraft speed, direction, altitude, and bank and nose attitude. The
        response to each maneuver command will depend on the type of aircraft
        you are flying, its altitude, speed, whether or not it is loaded, and
        the amount of damage it may have sustained. All movement is assumed to
        occur simultaneously, although Player 1 moves all of his aircraft
        before Player 2 moves his aircraft.  When moving an aircraft, the
        player will be presented with a tactical plot showing all visible
        aircraft up to 6-7 kft ahead and 2 kft behind the aircraft being
        moved, as described in section 4.5. Beneath the plot will be displayed
        the altitude, speed, initial heading, current heading, bank and nose
        attitude, maneuvers currently in progress, and distance already moved
        this turn. Information about maneuver capabilities at the aircraft's
        current speed and attitude can be obtained by using the CK command.
        Other aircraft displayed on the tactical plot can be identified using
        the ID command. These 2 non-maneuver commands are described in section
        5.7.

        There are nine different maneuver commands available:
                ST - Move aircraft straight ahead
                RR - Roll to the right (clockwise)
                RL - Roll to the left (counter-clockwise)
                TR - Turn right
                TL - Turn left
                SR - Sideslip right
                SL - Sideslip left
                NU - Nose up
                ND - Nose down

        Each of the maneuvers, except for move straight (ST), require the
        aircraft to move a certain distance, based on aircraft type, speed and
        altitude, before the maneuver is executed.  While this distance is
        being moved, the maneuver being executed is displayed as a "current
        maneuver." More than one maneuver of different types may be executed
        simultaneously, as long as a required nose or bank attitude is not
        changed during a turn, sideslip or half-loop maneuver. The computer
        will check the validity of all maneuvers and inform you whenever you
        attempt to execute an illegal maneuver. When you give the ST command
        the computer will ask you how far you want to move (from 0.1 kft up to
        the distance remaining to be moved). If you simply type (return), the
        distance moved will be the amount necessary before the next completion
        of a maneuver in progress. If there are no current maneuvers listed,
        then typing (return) will cause the aircraft to move the distance
        necessary to complete the current game turn. The remaining eight
        maneuver commands are described in sections 5.3 - 5.6.

5.2 Speed
        The current speed of an aircraft is displayed in miles per hour, to
        the nearest 10 mph. During each game turn an aircraft will move, in
        kilofeet, a distance equal to its speed divided by 100. Certain
        maneuvers will immediately reduce an aircraft's speed, so that the
        distance moved in the current turn also will be reduced. All maneuver
        commands except ST cause a delayed speed reduction. Delayed speed
        losses are not applied until the end of a turn, and so may be offset
        by speed gains resulting from applying power or diving.

5.2. Speed Regions
        It is important to be aware of three speed limits for your aircraft:
        stall speed, maximum level speed and maximum dive speed. These three
        speeds are shown, in order, on the aircraft capabilities display (see
        section 5.71). Stall speed is a function of bank attitude, increasing
        by 10 mph when in a standard bank or inverted, and by 20 mph in a
        steep bank. If an aircraft's speed at the start of a turn is below
        stall speed, then it will enter a spin, unless it is on the ground
        (zero altitude). Aircraft can move below stall speed along the ground
        to taxi, take off or land.  An aircraft in a spin will fall out of
        control at its maximum dive rate. It will move straight ahead the
        distance corresponding to its initial speed, but will end the turn
        with a randomly-determined heading. The speed gained in the dive will
        eventually end the spin when stall speed is once more exceeded.
        Maximum level speed is the highest speed an aircraft can attain in
        level flight Maximum dive speed is the highest speed an aircraft can
        move normally in a dive.  Speeds between level speed and dive speed
        can only occur as the result of acceleration due to gravity in a dive.
        On occasion a diving aircraft may exceed its maximum dive speed. If
        this should occur, the aircraft will become more difficult to control,
        with significant increases in the distances required to execute
        maneuvers - including pulling the nose up to come out of the dive!

5.22 Speed Changes
        Speed maybe increased by diving or by the application of power. Speed
        decreases may occur as the result of maneuvers, climbing or reducing
        power. After all movement commands have been executed in a given turn,
        You will be asked to select a power setting, an integer value from 0
        to 10. The available power range will be reduced, as required, to
        maintain speed above stall speed and below maximum dive speed. A power
        setting of 10 represents full throttle, while a setting of 0
        represents all possible actions which can be taken to reduce speed,
        except climbing or maneuvering. The speeds which the upper and lower
        power settings will produce are provided to help in determining the
        proper power setting. Speed changes resulting from climbing, diving or
        maneuvers are automatically factored into the upper and lower speeds
        available. if the currently displayed speed of your aircraft is
        between the upper and lower speeds available, then you may maintain
        that speed by simply typing (return) instead of entering a specific
        power setting.

5.3 Roll Maneuvers (RR, RL)
        Roll maneuvers are used to change an aircraft's bank attitude. There
        are eight possible bank attitudes:

                LV Wings level in normal flight
                R1 Standard right bank
                R2 Steep right bank
                IR Inverted right bank
                IV Wings level in inverted flight
                IL inverted left bank
                L2 Steep left bank
                L1 Standard left bank

        A change from one bank attitude to an adjacent attitude will result
        from a one-point roll. If the roll is to the right (RR command), the
        bank attitude will change to the next lower attitude on the above
        list, e.g., from LV to R1 . A one-point roll to the left (RL command)
        will cause a change to the next higher attitude on the list, e.g.,
        from L1 to L2. When either the RR or RL commands are given, you will
        be given the option of rolling 2 or more points with a single command.
        Rolling 2 or more points with a single command can be accomplished
        more rapidly than rolling the same number of points with a series of 1
        - point rolls, since in the latter case additional time is required to
        stop at each intermediate bank attitude. Each roll maneuver causes a
        delayed speed reduction of 10 mph.

5.4 Turn Maneuvers (TR, TL)
        A turn maneuver will cause a 45-degree change in an aircraft's heading
        in the direction of the turn. A turn to the right (TR) can be made in
        an R1 , R2 or IR bank attitude. An aircraft must be in an L1 , L2 or
        IL bank in order to make a left turn (TL). Turns made in the R2 and L2
        bank attitudes can be made in one-third the distance required for the
        other four attitudes. There is, however, both an immediate speed
        reduction of 20 mph and a delayed speed reduction of 30 mph for each
        turn maneuver made in an L2 or R2 bank. Turns made in the R1, IR, L1
        or IL attitudes suffer only a 10 mph delayed speed reduction. An
        aircraft which is moving below stall speed along the ground may turn
        either direction while in a LV bank attitude.

5.5 Sideslip Maneuver (SR, SL)
        The sideslip maneuver is used to move an aircraft to the side without
        a change of heading. The maneuver can only be made in a standard or
        inverted bank attitude. A sideslip to the right (SR) is possible when
        in either an R1 or IL bank attitude. An aircraft must be in an L1 or
        IR attitude in order to execute a sideslip left (SL). Note that when
        inverted, the sideslip will move the aircraft in the opposite
        direction from the bank. This is because a sideslip always occurs in
        the direction of the lower wing. A sideslip will result in a loss of
        0.3 kft in altitude and a sideways movement of 0-3 kft The altitude
        loss occurs immediately upon completion of the maneuver and is
        separate from any changes specified as a result of climbing or diving.
        There is an immediate speed reduction of 30 mph due to a sideslip, and
        a 20 mph delayed speed loss.

5.5 Pitch Maneuvers (NU, ND)
        Pitch maneuvers are used to bring the nose of your aircraft up (NU) or
        down (ND). There are five possible nose attitudes for an aircraft: H2
        nose up in steep climb, H1 nose up in normal climb, LV nose level, L1
        nose down in shallow dive, L2 nose down in steep dive.  The NU command
        will cause the nose of your aircraft to move to the next higher
        attitude on the above list, unless already in the H2 attitude.
        Similarly, unless in the L2 attitude, the ND command will move the
        nose of your aircraft to the next lower attitude. Issuing the NU
        command in H2 nose attitude or the ND command in L2 attitude will put
        your aircraft into a half-loop; this maneuver is discussed in section
        5.63. For an aircraft in a steep bank attitude, an NU command executed
        white in a steep dive (L2 nose attitude) will result in a 45-degree
        heading change in the bank direction, and a simultaneous change from
        steep bank to standard bank attitude, e.g., R2 to R1.

5.61  Climbing
        The nose of your aircraft must be in the H1 or H2 nose attitude in
        order to gain altitude by climbing. Aircraft in a steep bank attitude,
        R2 or L2, can only climb if in H2 nose attitude; for them the H2
        attitude is like H1 , and H1 is equivalent to LV. The H1 attitude is
        used for normal climbing, while the H2 attitude is used only to trade
        speed for altitude in a "zoom" climb, or to enter a climbing
        half-loop. Inverted aircraft may not be in an H2 nose attitude.
        Maximum altitude gain for a complete turn spent in the H1 nose
        attitude is shown on the capabilities display obtained using the CK
        command (section 5.71); minimum altitude gain is 0.01 kft. Aircraft
        which spend more than half a turn in an H1 nose attitude must climb at
        least 0.01 kft, unless they are in a steep bank attitude. For purposes
        of making this determination, time spent diving will offset time spent
        climbing. Maximum climb ability white in the H2 attitude is increased
        by an amount which depends upon the speed and type of aircraft.
        Aircraft suffer a delayed speed reduction while climbing. This speed
        loss varies according to aircraft type, but is between 10 and 50 mph
        per 0.1 kft in attitude gain. Most aircraft have sufficient power
        available, particularly at low altitude, to offset the speed loss due
        to climbing, and thereby maintain a constant speed in a maximum climb
        at H1 nose attitude. Speed loss in a zoom climb will occur very
        rapidly, however, so that remaining in H2 attitude for more than one
        turn will usually result in a stall. The climb rate of an aircraft
        drops to zero at its ceiling (maximum attitude, which is indicated on
        the Aircraft Data Card).

5.62 Diving
        Aircraft in an L1 or L2 nose attitude will lose altitude by diving.
        Altitude loss also occurs as a result of the sideslip maneuver, and
        for aircraft whose noses are level and are in a steep bank (L2 or R2)
        attitude. The maximum altitude loss indicated in the capabilities
        displayed using the CK command can only occur for a full turn spent in
        the L2 nose attitude. Minimum altitude loss in the L2 nose attitude is
        half of the maximum dive distance; this is also the maximum which can
        be lost while in the L1 nose attitude. The minimum altitude loss in
        the L1 attitude is 0.01 kft. If in a steep bank attitude, minimum
        altitude loss with the nose level will be between 0.1 and 0.2 kft; in
        the L1 nose attitude it will be half the maximum dive distance; and
        the L2 nose attitude forces an aircraft to dive to its maximum amount.
        Time spent climbing will offset time spent diving in making this
        determination. Diving results in a delayed speed increase of between
        10 and 30 mph for each .1 kft of altitude loss, depending on aircraft
        type. For most aircraft, speed will build up rapidly in a steep dive.
        Using minimum power will offset some of the speed build-up, but for
        many aircraft this will not be enough to allow it to spend very many
        turns diving its maximum amount before exceeding maximum dive speed.
        It is not advisable to exceed maximum dive speed, since distance which
        must be moved to execute maneuvers will be greatly increased.

5.63 Half-loops
        Executing an NU command with an aircraft in H2 nose attitude will
        cause your aircraft to perform a climbing half-loop. Similarly, an ND
        command while in L2 nose attitude will initiate a diving half-loop. At
        the completion of a half-loop, an aircraft will undergo a bank
        attitude reversal (the equivalent of what happens in a half-roll) and
        a heading reversal. For example, an aircraft heading north in an L1
        bank will complete a climbing half-loop heading south in an IR bank
        attitude. Half-loops cannot be performed in a steep bank (R2 or L2)
        attitude. An aircraft must be inverted in order to execute a diving
        half-loop, and cannot be inverted in a climbing half-loop. An aircraft
        therefore will complete a climbing half-loop in an inverted bank
        attitude, and since the H2 nose attitude is prohibited while inverted,
        the nose attitude will change to H1. When executing a half-loop,
        aircraft must climb or dive a fixed distance; this distance depends on
        the speed at which the aircraft begins the maneuver. There is an
        immediate speed reduction of 10 mph when entering a half-loop, in
        addition to the delayed speed reduction of 10 mph associated with the
        ND or NU maneuver. It is advisable to enter a climbing half-loop at a
        relatively high speed to avoid a stall, and a diving half-loop at low
        speed to prevent maximum dive speed from being exceeded.

5.7 Check Capabilities (CK) and identify Aircraft (ID) Commands
        There are two non-maneuver commands which may be given during the
        movement phase. One of these commands is used to obtain information on
        the maneuver capabilities of your aircraft at its present speed and
        altitude; the other to identify aircraft appearing on the tactical
        plot.

5.71 Check Capabilities (CK) 
        The CK command will provide a 3-line summary of the current
        capabilities of the aircraft you are moving. Below is a sample display
        of the information presented:

                RR .3   RL .5   TR 3.9   SR 1.1
                NU .2   ND .5   CL .52   DV 1.09
                PWR  -20 to +50   SPD 90,330,420

        The first line shows how far the aircraft must move to execute roll,
        turn or sideslip maneuvers. Only maneuvers which are possible in the
        current bank attitude will be displayed, so the aircraft in the
        example above must be in an R1 bank. If this airplane should roll
        right (RR) to an R2 attitude, then the top line would change to:

                RR .8   RL .3   TR 1.3

        The second line in the CK display indicates the distance which must be
        moved for pitch maneuvers, and the maximum climb and dive distances.
        The climb distance assumes a full turn in the H1 nose attitude and the
        dive distance a full turn in the L2 nose attitude. The last line shows
        the maximum amounts speed can be decreased or increased by changing
        the power setting; it also shows the limits for the different speed
        regions - stall speed, minimum level speed and maximum dive speed.

5.72 Indentification Command (ID)
        The ID command is used both to determine the identity of aircraft
        whose symbol appears on the tactical plot, and to obtain information
        about the altitude, speed, nose attitude, etc., of such aircraft.
        Below is an example of the information presented:

                GE V-1 #1  ALT 2.6  SPD 370
                HDG W   BNK LV   NOSE LV
                RANGE 4.9  ALTITUDE DIFFERENCE -1.1

        When the ID command is issued, one aircraft symbol on the display will
        begin flashing on and off. If you wish to obtain the above data on
        this aircraft, type (Y), but do NOT type (return). To move on to
        another aircraft, type (return) and a different aircraft symbol will
        start to flash. This selection process is continued until you have
        been given an opportunity to identify all aircraft on the screen.

6.0 Visibility
        Many World War II pilots first became aware of the presence of enemy
        aircraft when they were attacked, and by then it was often too late!
        In Computer Air Combat each player is made aware only of those
        aircraft which are currently visible to one of his own aircraft. The
        following factors determine whether or not an aircraft will be seen by
        an opponent.

6.1 Aircraft Type
        The cockpit design, location and other structural features of an
        aircraft influence how difficult it is for its pilot or crew to spot
        other planes. Aircraft with multiple crew members can sight other
        aircraft more readily than can single-seat fighters. In the game, each
        aircraft type is rated for visibility in 12 separate relative bearing
        and altitude sectors.

6.2 Enemy Aircraft Size
        The larger an airplane, the farther away it can be seen. Each aircraft
        has a size factor which determines both how far away it can be spotted
        and how easy it is to hit when fired upon.

6.3 Enemy Aircraft Relative Location
        Relative bearing and altitude have the greatest influence on
        visibility. An aircraft directly ahead can be detected at ranges about
        25 times greater than one directly behind. Aircraft are also easier to
        spot if they are near or above your own altitude.

6.4 Relative Motion
        An aircraft which is moving directly towards or away from you is more
        difficult to see than one which is moving across your field of view.

6.5 Environment
        Scenarios can occur either during daylight or at night. Night
        visibility ranges are considerably less than during daytime. The
        location of the sun, if present during day scenarios, can
        significantly affect visibility. Aircraft are much harder to spot if
        you have to look for them into the sun. There is a 50% chance of the
        sun being present for daytime scenarios starting at 5 kft or below.
        This probability increases slightly for higher starting altitudes,
        reflecting the increased likelihood of action taking place above the
        clouds.

6.6 Pilot Quality
        An ace often got that way partly by being able to see enemy aircraft
        before they saw him, and this ability is reflected in the game. An
        inexperienced pilot, on the other hand, is not able to spot other
        aircraft as well as an average pilot.

7.0 Combat (C)
        The (C)ombat command will initiate a check for all possible
        opportunities for friendly aircraft to attack enemy aircraft As each
        opportunity is determined by the computer, you will be given the
        option of whether or not to make the attack. This procedure continues
        until all attack possibilities have been presented. After both players
        have completed their combat phases, a damage report will be displayed,
        showing all aircraft which were damaged or destroyed.

7.1 Aircraft Armament
        There are two basic types of armament: forward-firing guns and turret
        guns. Forward-firing guns can fire only at targets located in front of
        the aircraft. Turret guns have fields of fire which vary according to
        the type of aircraft.

7.11 Forward-firing Guns
        All fighters have forward-firing guns as their principal armament.
        There are two different varieties of forward-firing gun: Cannon (CN)
        and Machine Gun (MG). In the game, the only difference between these
        two varieties is in their ammunition supply, which is described in
        more detail in section 7.5. Each forward-firing gun has a firepower
        factor associated with it, which is used to calculate the damage it
        can inflict on another aircraft. The number of forward-firing guns,
        their type and firepower, are indicated on the airplane
        characteristics card. This information is also obtainable using the
        (S)tatus command (section 4.6). Any guns which have been knocked out
        as the result of an enemy attack will not appear on the status
        display. For each aircraft with forward-firing guns there is a
        firepower quality parameter which indicates the relative quality of
        the aircraft as a firing platform. Firepower quality includes such
        factors as the location of the guns and the quality of the gunsight
        The firing arc of forward-firing guns extends 45 degrees to the side
        (as shown by the firing arc lines on the tactical display), and 45
        degrees above and below the firing aircraft. Each up or down shift in
        the nose attitude moves the vertical firing arc limits up or down 22.5
        degrees.

7.12 Turret Guns
        All bombers and some twin-engined fighters in the game have turret
        guns. The firepower of all turret guns possessed by an aircraft is
        represented by a single factor. Therefore all turret guns must fire at
        the same target in a single turn. Relative target location is
        expressed in terms of whether the target is above, below, or at nearly
        the same altitude as the firing aircraft, and whether it is ahead,
        ahead and to the side, behind and to the side, or behind.

7.2 Attack Effectiveness
        Several factors influence whether or not an attack will be successful
        in hitting the target aircraft. The most important is firing range,
        followed by target aspect. Other factors include target size, pilot
        quality, maneuvers performed by the firing aircraft, and its firepower
        quality parameter. The maximum firing range is 2.5 kft, where there is
        less than a 50% chance of hitting a bomber-sized target from behind.
        The likelihood of successful attack increases steadily as range
        decreases, until almost any attack from within 0.4 kft will score some
        hits. The number of hits scored on the target from a successful attack
        is primarily a function of the firepower factors of the firing
        aircraft and the firing range.

7.3 Damage Assessment
        Damage assessment occurs at the conclusion of both players combat
        phases. The number of hits scored on each target aircraft from all
        attacks on it are allocated to various parts of the aircraft wings,
        fuselage, cockpit, engine and guns. This allocation is based on a
        random distribution corresponding to the general type of aircraft. The
        total damage received by each part of the aircraft that was hit is
        compared to the maximum damage which can be taken by that particular
        part. Once the maximum is exceeded for any one part, the aircraft is
        destroyed. There is a slight chance of scoring a critical hit which
        would destroy the aircraft each time a cockpit, engine or wing is hit.
        These critical hits correspond to hitting the pilot, a crucial engine
        part, or igniting the fuel tanks. The extent of damage received by an
        aircraft is known only to the player who controls it, and is
        obtainable using the (S)tatus command (section 4.6). The player making
        the attack is told only whether or not any hits were scored.

7.4 Damage Effects
        Damage received by an aircraft can affect its performance
        characteristics, as described below.

7.41 Cockpit Hits
        Aircraft which have received cockpit hits become more difficult to
        maneuver, because of injuries to the pilot or damage to instruments or
        controls.

7.42 Engine Hits
        Hits on the engine result in reduced power and climb rate.
        Multi-engine aircraft can continue to fly. Each engine which is lost
        will reduce maximum level speed as well as power and climb rate.

7.43 Fuselage Hits
        Fuselage hits on aircraft with turret guns have a slight chance of
        reducing the total turret firepower.

7.44 Gun Hits
        Each gun hit on an aircraft with forward-firing guns will knock out
        one gun. If there are no forward-firing guns, then turret firepower is
        reduced by one factor.

7.45 Wing Hits
        The effect of each wing hit is to reduce the maximum level speed and
        maximum dive speed of an aircraft.

7.5 Ammunition Supply
        Each attack conducted by a plane with forward-firing guns will reduce
        the ammunition supply by one for each type of gun (CN or MG) firing.
        When the ammunition supply for a gun type is reduced to zero, then
        that type of gun may no longer fire. The current ammunition supply is
        indicated on the (S)tatus display (section 4-6). Turret guns are
        assumed always to have an adequate supply of ammunition.

8.0 Scenario Selection
        The five scenarios in Computer Air Combat are described on the Game
        Selection Card- Briefly, the Air Race scenario permits you to hold
        multi-player air races, to learn the procedures for moving an airplane
        in the game if you have not done so before, or to become more familiar
        with the maneuver characteristics of a particular aircraft type. The
Night Fighter scenario challenge the solitaire player to intercept and destroy
randomly-appearing targets while flying a single aircraft.  The Bomber
Formation intercept and Dogfight scenarios provide the opportunity to have
several aircraft controlled by each player. The computer "Otto" pilot will
also control the player 2 aircraft to permit solitaire play of these two
scenarios - Starting conditions either can be selected by the players or
chosen at random by the computer- You can use your imagination or knowledge of
actual World War II aerial engagements to set up your own scenario variations.

9.0 Familiarization Flight Example
        This section describes the first few turns of a familiarization flight
        in a P-47D. This description is intended to help players learn some of
        the procedures involved in flying an aircraft in Computer Air Combat.
        It is recommended that new players follow the play of this example
        using their computer.

9.1 Scenario Set
        Up After loading the program from the game disc you will first
        indicate that you want a (N)ew game, and then select scenario 1.  Next
        specify that you don't want an air race course set up, that you want 1
        aircraft, and that it is a US P-47D (Type index 4). When asked to
        enter a speed and altitude, select a speed of 300 mph and an altitude
        of 25 kft.

9.2 Maneuver Examples
        When Turn 1 begins, you will be shown a menu of command options.
        Select (M)ove aircraft and you will shortly see a tactical display for
        your aircraft, with status information and a request for a maneuver
        command below the plot.  Let's first try a standard turn to the left.
        We must be in an L1 bank attitude to make this turn, so our initial
        maneuver command is RL (roll left) 1 point.  Now move straight until
        the roll maneuver is completed by executing the ST command, followed
        by (return) when asked "How Far (.1-3)?". Now initiate the turn
        maneuver using the TL command, and again move straight until the
        maneuver is completed- This time, however, the game turn ends without
        having completed our left turn. We end Turn 1 by using maximum power,
        10, to increase speed to 330.
        At the start of Turn 2 movement we see that TL still shows as a
        current maneuver. Moving straight to complete this maneuver, we find
        that it takes an additional 2.6 kft, making an overall total of 5.1
        kft. Now let's try a left turn in a steep bank attitude. First we must
        roll left 1 more point; this maneuver is completed in 0.3 kft. Next
        enter the TL command and notice that our speed drops to 310- Move
        straight to complete the game turn, using maximum power to maintain a
        speed of 310.
        For Turn 3, let's move straight until our left turn is completed (1.6
        kft), and then for the remainder of the game turn. At the end of this
        turn, even though our nose is level we must lose at least 0.2 kft
        since we are in a steep bank.  Losing this altitude does have the
        effect of permitting us to build our speed up to 370, if desired.
        However, let's prepare to enter a diving half-loop next turn by
        cutting our speed to 300 (power setting 0). In order to execute a
        diving half-loop, we must be inverted and drop the nose below L2. We
        can initiate both actions simultaneously by entering the ND and RL ( 1
        point) commands at the start of Turn 4. Moving straight, we find that
        the ND command is completed first, after moving .3 kft, and we issue
        another ND command at that point continuing to move straight, .g kft.
        Execute ND, followed by ST, which ends the game turn and completes the
        half-loop, with our aircraft heading S in an R1 bank altitude. Note
        the large dive distance and speed increase which has occurred during
        the diving half-loop - now it is clear why we cut back on power at the
        end of Turn 3! And with that observation, we leave you to continue
        this familiarization flight on your own.

10.0  Hints on Tactics
        Tactics employed by successful fighter pilots in World War II are the
        same tactics which will lead to success in Computer Air Combat.  Some
        of these basic tactical principles are presented here to help increase
        your enjoyment of the game.

10.1 Expect the Unexpected
        Finding the enemy is the first step in any conflict. Obviously you
        can't shoot what you can't see, yet it's all too easy to be shot at by
        a plane you have not seen. So anytime you have not spotted any hostile
        aircraft, be on the lookout.  Change the heading of your aircraft
        every now and then in order to vary your blind spot, and possibly
        upset the timing of an unseen aircraft which may be setting up for an
        attack on you. Be especially wary of attacks out of the sun, or from
        behind and below. If you have more than one aircraft, position and
        maneuver them so that they can mutually support each other.

10.2 Be Aggressive
        Fighter pilots are fundamentally offense-minded.  Good defense may win
        football or basketball games, but it usually won't work in a dogfight;
        the best defense here is truly a good offense! Step one of being
        aggressive is to point the nose of your aircraft at the enemy.
        Whenever you turn away from an opponent you run the risk of losing
        sight of him, or worse yet, finding him on your tail. Make a head-on
        pass, if necessary, and then maneuver to again point your aircraft's
        nose at your opponent as quickly as possible.

10.3 Know Your Aircraft
        Each type of aircraft has a different combination of strengths and
        weaknesses. It is important to know your aircraft's strengths and
        weaknesses relative to your opponent's aircraft.  Among the most
        essential performance characteristics are turn rate. climb rate and
        dive rate, particularly how these vary with speed and altitude -
        Acceleration and deceleration ability, and maximum and minimum speed
        values are also important. Once you know your relative strengths,
        exploit them! Use superior climb rate to gain an altitude advantage
        whenever possible. Fight "in the horizontal" by turning towards your
        opponent if your airplane has a better turn rate - Use superior
        acceleration in a dive to build up speed more quickly, or to escape
        when in trouble. If your aircraft's performance improves more than
        your opponent's at a higher or lower speed or altitude, then attempt
        to move the engagement in that direction - When attacking bombers,
        usually it is safest to attack from below and either directly ahead or
        behind, and at as high a speed as possible.

10.4 Conserve Speed and Altitude
        Speed and altitude are both easily lost in a dogfight, so it is
        important not to lose either needlessly. These two factors are
        somewhat interchangeable, since you can trade altitude for speed by
        diving, and speed for altitude in a zoom climb. Acquire and maintain
        an altitude advantage whenever possible, since this will usually
        permit you to initiate an attack when you choose to do so. Maneuvers
        will cost you speed, so it's usually a good idea to keep your speed up
        when not maneuvering.

11.0  Designer's Notes
        Achieving a proper balance between realism and playability is one of a
        game designer's foremost challenges- Our intent in designing Computer
        Air Combat was to create a game that was first and foremost
        interesting and fun to play, but would still contain enough realism to
        give players the "feel" of tactical aerial combat.  Another design
        philosophy was to place greater emphasis on involving players in the
        decision-making process (e.g., climb, turn, accelerate) of flying a
        plane in combat, and less emphasis on the mechanical process
        (e.g.,stick and rudder movements). The game design also reflects the
        unique advantages afforded by computers in permitting the use of
        incomplete information regarding hostile aircraft locations and extent
        of damage, and in taking care of the numerous record-keeping details,
        thus allowing the players to concentrate on the more exciting aspects
        of the game. Players are given both a commander's overview
        perspective, by being able to fly more than one plane at a time and
        view a global plot of the action, and a pilot's perspective when it
        comes to moving each individual aircraft. The selection of which
        aircraft to include in the game was not easy. The original plan was to
        focus on about a dozen of the most famous allied and axis fighters,
        but the list rapidly expanded to the present three dozen fighter and
        bomber types, and it easily could have increased still more. The final
        decisions on aircraft types and variants to include were made on the
        basis of providing a balance of early ('39-'43) ad late ('44-'45)
        types, and of providing principal opponents of both sides of the major
        aerial campaigns of World War II - the Battle of Britain, the Pacific
        carrier battles, and the strategic bombing offensives against Germany
        and Japan. Considerable effort was expended to make the performance
        data as accurate and consistent as possible, and numerous sources were
        used in this process. Unfortunately, these sources were not uniformly
        complete or consistent in the data presented. Qualitative comments and
        judgements therefore had to be relied upon in several instances, it is
        our hope that any disagreements with these design decisions will not
        detract unduly from the enjoyment of what we believe is fundamentally
        a fun game to play.
