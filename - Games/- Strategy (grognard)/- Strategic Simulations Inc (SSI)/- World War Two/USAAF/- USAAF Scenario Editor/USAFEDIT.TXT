USAFEDIT v1.0 by Nicholas Bell  An Editor Utility for SSI's USAAF 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This editor enables the user to easily edit existing scenarios, air units,
aircraft, etc or create new scenarios for SSI's USAAF (by Gary Grisby)
released in the 1980's for Apple IIs. USAFEDIT.ZIP should contain the
following files:

        USAFEDIT.TXT (this file)
        USAFEDIT.EXE

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS:
Thanks to Randy Spurlock and David Ellsworth for creating ApplePC, 
Michael O'Brien for AppleWin, and that unnamed person who kindly
dealt with the hassle of converting USAAF so we could enjoy
it once again!

                           *** WARNING ***
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program can make permanent modifications to *.IMG files created by
APPLEPC.  Be sure to backup the original *.IMG files.
                            
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy the USAFEDIT.EXE file into your main directory where you maintain your
USAAF game and type "USAFEDIT" <return> to start the editor (if in DOS or a
DOS Window). USAFEDIT also works fine under Win 3.1 and Win95.  Either run
USAFEDIT or double click on USAFEDIT.EXE while in your favorite file manager.

You can also change the name of USAFEDIT.EXE to whatever doesn't conflict
with other programs, if you don't like typing out USAFEDIT.  Just be sure
to keep it an EXE program.  Example: HACK.EXE

INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This editor only works with SAVE STATE Image files (*.IMG) created by
ApplePC. (you can still play using AppleWin - see below)

1.  Start USAAF as a 2 player game.  At the first USAAF Morning Briefing
before doing anything, use the [S] Save State function of ApplePC.
You can use any allowable file name.  ApplePC will automatically add
the *.IMG extension.
2.  Quit ApplePC.
3.  Start USAFEDIT and load the Save State Image you just made.  Edit away!
4.  The edited IMG is saved when you quit USAFEDIT.
5.  Fire up ApplePC and [L] Load State your Image file. 
6.  Continue the scenario.
7.  To play using AppleWin, save the game at the earliest point from within
the game to a *.DSK.  Then restart the saved game using AppleWin.
Sorry. it's the best I can do at this point.  Hex editing the savegame disk
images is very difficult because of the small Apple disk sector size.  Data is
not in complete strings (no arrays here!) with one type of data cutting
right through the middle of another.

SUGGESTION:  When you're editing make the new day one day earlier than
the current day.  If you're editing the Full Campaign Game, make the date
July 31, 1943.  When you restart the Save State, continue playing the game,
but doing nothing for either side (you did start the game as a 2 player game
like I said, right <g>?).  Save the game normally (not save state!) at the
end of the Luftwaffe Deployment Phase.  Exit the game.

Start USAAF over, as a one or two player game as you choose, loading the just
saved game and continue through the Luftwaffe Situation Room.  Since no raids
were planned, the game will continue throught the production and repair phase
to the Luftwaffe or USAAF Morning Briefing (dependent on who you're playing).
Now you're at August 1st and ready to start the game.  Plus you'll have cloud
cover on the first turn!  I always thought it was pretty silly having zero
cloud cover in all zones on the first turn.

DETAILS
~~~~~~~
Use of the editor is fairly self-explanatory given familarity with the
game program and the manual (which explains most of the stuff you can edit).
There are a few items which require further explaination.

Specific notes by Editing Module:

1.  AIRCRAFT
I use the raw data values throughout the editor.  You'll note the halfing
and multiplying from the listed values in the game documentation.  Don't
know why Gary programmed it this way.

Cannon-Weapon ratings are as follows:

1/2     .30 cal/7.62mm MG
1       .50 cal/13mm MG
2       15mm Cannon
4       20mm Cannon
5       30mm Cannon

LOAD is either rocket or bomb load, dependent on which side is using the
plane.  (Consider adding 2 rockets to the Me-163.  The Germans actually
experimented with upward firing rockets which required the Komet pilot 
to fly under the US bomber so that the bomber's shadow would activate the
photocell trigger!)

What CLASS does is not known to me at the moment of writing, but I hope
it specifies which aircraft benefit from the reduced loss rate of jets,
or it's going to be tough to add P-80s and Meteors.  This would also make
it the determinant on which combat (fighter vs fighter or fighter vs bomber)
the program should use.

FW-190Fs were never used in the Reichsverteidigung.

Sorry, you cannot ADD planes, so if you want to make a new plane type 
you'll have to give up an existing type.

LUFTWAFFE UNITS
Pretty self-explanatory.  Note that the value for which month the unit appears
IS different from the month aircraft are available - this is not an error.

Adding pilots will prevent the dilution of German unit experience levels if
you make sure the number of pilots is always greater than the number of
planes.

Note than the Geschwader number is stored as one byte.  Thus the highest
number is 256.  This precludes including JG 400 (the Komet unit).

If you want to be realistic you should eliminate (set the arrival month into
1946) all SG's, SKG's, KG(j), and EJG's.  They never participated in the
Reichsverteidigung.  They were added for play balance.  The various elements
of JG 300, JG 301, and JG 302 which did participate are missing.  Please
check my web site for accurate Orders of Battle.

USAAF UNITS
Instead of tracking the number of pilots (the Allies never ran short!) Gary
tracks the unit's base location.  (The German unit base location is kept
in a seperate group of data strings which I decided I wasn't going to
bother with).

These values are explained well in the documentation and don't require
any further explanation:
TARGETS
FACTORY DEFENSE VALUES
FACTORY OPTIMUM LEVELS
FACTORY REBUILD LEVELS

DATES
An important note! The various scenarios in USAAF all use the SAME DATA with
the program editing the locations, strengths, experience and morale levels.
I cannot control this.  So when you edit the 1943, you are also editing the
raw data for the two 1944 scenarios.

FUEL RESERVE
Great way to work around the fuel shortage.  Unfortunately it is a single
byte of data, so the max value can only be 256.

WEATHER
Be sure to enter a Cloud Cover value in 5% increments.

Please post modifications or new scenarios for others to enjoy.  Check out
my homepage at: http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/NicholasBell
for other wargame utilities and scenarios.  I'll be posting information on
how to make USAAF more historical and any alternate OB's I make or receive
from others.

Enjoy!
