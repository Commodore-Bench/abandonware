The following disk images are revisions to SSI's USSAF published in 1985
and can only be played using an Apple Emulator.

These images are revised USAAF1.DSK images.  To use just start them instead
of the USAAF1.DSK.  At the bottom of first menu screen the alternate version
number will be highlighted instead of the game version number.  Note that
if you start the game in Feb '44 or Sept '44, these changes are also
in effect.  If you play Alt #1, the FW 190D will be availabile in the
Feb '44 scenario.

I would normally make up an editor for this, but limited interest in this
game precludes me from spending the time.  Coding an editor for this would
be time consuming because of the sector structure of the disk images.
Data is scattered all over the image instead of being in a single block.

Hex editing the files is much easier and quicker.  I will be happy to
hack any suggestions within my capablility, so please drop me a line
if you want to see some variant.

What I can edit:

1.  Aircraft characteristics, cost to produce, and availibility.  You cannot
add any planes, so if you want a new plane it has to take the place of an
existing aircraft.

2.  Aircraft Unit characteristics including type and number of serviceable
and unserviceable planes, training level, morale, and arrival date.

3.  Industry growth rates, defense levels, optimal levels.

4.  Target industry types, flak levels, types of aircraft produced.

5.  Weather, month, date, etc.

What the Alternate DSK's contain:

Alt #1	Accelerates arrival of German aircraft types by about 6 months.
I've never agreed with the game that factory space is directly related
to technological advances.

Alt #2  As #1 with new German units having an initial training level
of 50.

Alt #3. Per original game, except replace ME-109 with HE-100.  This
alternate assumes that Messerschmidt's political connections were
not as good as they were and the BETTER plane actually was chosen
by the Luftwaffe.  Since they both used the same engine I have
extrapolated the following data:

HE-100F:
Cannon:  1 x 30mm (prop hub), 2 x 20mm (in wing root)
Rockets: 2
Cruise Speed: 276 mph
Climb Rate:  2200 fpm
Ceiling:  38,000'
Endurance:  105 min
Durability: 18
Manuever Rating:  46

HE-100G:
Cannon:  1 x 30mm (prop hub), 2 x 20mm (in wing root)
Rockets: 2
Cruise Speed: 300 mph
Climb Rate:  3000 fpm
Ceiling:  40,000'
Endurance:  105 min
Durability: 18
Manuever Rating:  50

The HE-100 was a pure interceptor - lightweight, very small wings, and
fast.  The real He-100D-1 max speed in 1940 was 416 mph at 16,400'!

In Alt #3 the He-100G appears when the Me-109K does.

I am also working on improving the "fun" but very inaccurate USAAF
Order of Battle.  See attached Excel file for the actual US
Fighter Group OB looked like, as an example.
