1.0 INTRODUCTION
MECH BRIGADE is a platoon-level tactical game of hypothetical future 
combat between the forces of NATO and the Soviet Union.
1.1 Description of Action:
Each game turn consists of two phases. In the orders phase, the 
players, one at a time, give orders to the units which they control. In the 
joint combat phase all units carry out these orders, one unit at a time. The 
combat phase represents two minutes of action, broken down into four 
30-second pulses. 
1.2 Talking to the Computer:
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers, type the 
number into the computer and press the <RETURN> key. To select a routine from 
a menu or answer a Yes/No question, just press the desired key. WHERE THE 
EXIT COMMAND IS NOT SPECIFIED, PRESS <X> TO EXIT THE MENU.
1.3 Saving a Game: 
At the end of the DEPLOYMENT PHASE and at the end of each COMBAT PHASE, 
the computer will allow the player(s) to save the game in progress. You will 
need a scratch disk to store the save game data. Save game disks may be 
initialized for SSI use during a game by following Instructions included in 
the game program. Each save disk with hold approximately 4-6 games. Warning: 
the program will not prompt you when you have exceeded the disk space on your 
save game disk.  Once a game is saved you with be able to restart it at the 
point you left off.
WHEN RESTARTING A SAVED GAME YOU MUST SET THE CORRECT NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON 
THE OPENING MENU.
1.4  The Map:
The MECH BRIGADE map is a 60 X 60 square grid with each square 
measuring 200 yards across. At the start of each game the terrain is 
randomized in accordance with parameters determined by the player.
1.5 Starting the Game (Apple):
To begin the game, boot side one and the game will begin automatically. 
If you are using an Apple II with Pascal you must first use your BASICS disk. 
If you are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple II emulation mode. 
if you elect to play a historical scenario, the computer will ask You to 
insert side two of the disk so that it may read in the scenario data. when 
this is complete the computer will instruct you to reinsert side one for the 
remainder of the game.
1.6 Starting the Game (Atari):
To begin the game, boot the Scenario side of Your disk. Before 
beginning remove all cartridges from your computer. Owners of the 8OOXL will 
have to hold down the OPTION key when they turn on their computer to boot the 
game. After you have deployed your forces (or after you have selected to play 
a historicaL scenario) , the computer will ask you to insert the Game side of 
your disk.
1.7 Starting the Game (Commodore):
To begin the game, insert the game disk into Your disk drive. Type LOAD 
' *", 8 and press <RETURN> . When READY appears, type RUN and press <RETURN> 
. 
1.8 Sound:

3.0   STARTING THE GAME
3.1 Determining Conditions of Play:
   At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under 
which the game will be played. On the Apple version the conditions may be 
changed by entering  the following numbers:
(1)  NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2)  1 DISK DRIVE or 2 DISK DRIVES
(3)  SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(4)  HANDICAP LEVEL
(5)  DELAY LENGTH
(6)  SELECT SCENARIO
On the ATARI and C-64'" versions:
(1)  NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2)  SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(3)  HANDICAP LEVEL
(4)  DELAY LENGTH
(5)  SELECT SCENARiO
3.2  Player Determination:
MECH BRIGADE may be played by either zero, one, or two players, and 
this is determined by the option selected on the menu. For example, if you 
wished to watch a computer controlled German force face a computer controlled 
Russian force, you should select the option BOTH COMPUTER.
3.3   Handicap Level:
At the start of the game the players must determine the handicap level 
(1-5) . The effects of handicap levels are listed below:
Level 1:  NATO strength reduced 50%
Level 2:  NATO strength reduced 25%
LeveL 3:  No reduction
Level 4:  Soviet strength reduced 25%
Level 5:  Soviet strength reduced 50%
EXAMPLE: At level 1 the number of weapons in German platoons would be reduced 
by approximately 50%.
The handicap level will not affect the four "historical scenarios," as 
the computer will automatically assign a handicap level of 3 when these 
scenarios are played.
3.4 Delay Length:
The delay length affects messages displayed during the Combat Phase. 
The greater the delay length, the longer these messages will remain displayed 
during the Combat Phase. A delay length of 1 will speed up the game, but will 
cause the messages to be virtually unreadable. A delay length of 9 will slow  
the game considerably, but will allow the player maximum time to study the 
various reports provided during the Combat Phase. Any integer between 1 to 9 
may be entered.
3.5 Selecting a Scenario:
You may select one of 4 historical scenarios (see section 9.0), or you 
may elect to build your own scenario. If you select a historical scenario, 
the computer will skip the deployment phase and go directly to turn 1. If you 
elect to build your own scenario you will be asked several questions (see 
sections 3.6-3.9). New players are advised to begin by playing scenarios they 
have created. Creating and playing a small meeting engagement is recommended. 
Do not attempt to play historical scenarios until you are completely  
familiar with the game.
3.6  Building the Map:
At the start of the game the computer will generate a new map. Prior to 
generating the map the computer will allow the player(s) to input parameters 
that influence the nature of the terrain:
(1)  INCLUDE RIVER Y/N
(2)  COVER TERRAiN DENSITY (O-9)
If option (1) is answered "Y" then the map will include a river. Option 
(2) allows the players to control quantity of woods and broken terrain 
included on the map. A "0" would allow no woods/broken terrain on the map; a 
"9" would mean heavy woods/ broken terrain density. Any number between 0 and 
9 may be entered.
3.6  Selecting the Time Period:
The player(s) may select from eight different time periods. The time 
period will affect the type of forces/equipment that may be used in the 
battle as well as the command control capabilities of the two armies.
3.7   Selecting the Type of Battle:
The player(s) may select from five different types of battle:
(1) NATO PURSUIT
A small Soviet force fights a rear-guard action against a large NATO 
force,
(2)  NATO ASSAULT
A large NATO force attacks a medium Soviet force. Both sides may use 
off-map artillery.
(3) MEETING ENGAGEMENT
Opposing forces of equal strength advance on the same objective.
(4) SOVIET ASSAULT
A large Soviet force attacks a medium NATO force. Both sides may use 
off-map artillery.
(5) SOVIET PURSUIT
A small NATO force fights a rear-guard action against a large Soviet 
force.
The player(s) must also determine the size of the battle:
(1) LARGE
(2) SMALL
In a "small" battle the quantity of units on both sides will be reduced 
by approximately 50%.
3.8  Selecting NATO Nationality:
The NATO player may choose to use the equipment and organizations of 
the following (1) U.S. (2)WEST GERMANY (3) GREAT BRITAIN (4) FRANCE.
3.9  Selecting Forces:
First the players must decide to use either OLD or NEW EQUIPMENT. The 
player will receive 25 additional selection points of he chooses OLD 
equipment.
The players have a limited number of selection points (SPs) that they 
may use to "buy" various types of companies or battalions. The computer will 
only allow the selection of formations that are appropriate for the type of 
force selected.
Before each game, the computer will randomly determine which player has 
air superiority. That player will be allowed to purchase up to one attack 
helicoptr squadron (AH squadron).
The player(s) will receive 20 victory points for each SP that is not 
used to buy combat formations. A maximum of 250 points may be received in 
this manner.
If the AUTO-SELECT routine is used then the computer will select a 
force to suit the type of battle. The AUTO-SELECT will never purchase 
helicopter or independent air-defense units.
4.0 DEPLOYMENT:
When creating a new scenario, the player(s) may arrange their units on 
the map before the game begins to optimize their attack or defense. NATO 
units may not be deployed east (right) of their "start line" and Soviet units 
may not be deployed west (left) of their "start line." If the AUTO-DEPLOY 
routine is used then the computer will automatically deploy the units on the 
map. AUTO-DEPLOY will not provide the best possible deployment; it represents 
a "hasty" deployment. If the AUTO-DEPLOY routine is not used, the players 
will find their units at the top of the map.
4.1 Combat Formations:
All units in the game are organized into combat formations (CFs). CFs 
consist of a headquarters (HQ) unit with from 1 to 8 attached combat units. 
CFs are each assigned an identification letter (A-U) . The units attached to 
a CF are each assigned an index number (0-9) . The formation letter and the 
index number are combined to form the unit ID. EXAMPLE: the 3rd unit in 
formation C would have C3 as its UNIT ID.
The HQ unit in all CFs will be assigned index number "0".
4.2 The Map Display:
The map display used in MECH BRIGADE is a 60 X 60 square grid. Only a 
fraction of the map (20 squares wide by 10 squares high) may be viewed at one 
time. By pressing the keys 1-8 the cursor can be moved around the map (1-N, 
2-NE, 3-E, 4-SE, 5-S, 6-SW, 7-W, 8-NW). If the cursor is moved to the edge of 
the display then the map will scroll to reveal the hidden portions of the 
map. When playing an assault type battle, the map is reduced to 60 X 30 (60 
spaces east-west by 30 spaces north-south).
4.3 Unit Symbols:
All units on the map are identified by symbols that describe their 
function and nationality.
SOVIET VEHICLES are represented by vehicle silhouettes facing west.
SOVIET INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men underlined.
SOViET ARTILLERY is represented by an underlined weapon symbol.
SOVIET STACK is represented by two overlapping white squares.
NATO VEHICLES are represented by vehicle silhouettes facing east.
NATO INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men (no underline).
NATO ARTILLERY is represented by a weapon symbol (no underline).
NATO STACK is represented by two hollow overlapping squares.
CONFLICT (opposing forces on same square) is represented by an SU/NA symbol.
4.4   Map Display Menu:
The map display menu lists the following routines:
(1-8)  Move cursor.
  (9)  Build entrenchment (only before ASSAULT type battles).
  (0)  Use auto-deploy routine.
(A-T)  Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index
  number computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU.
  (U)  Change terrain in square (see appendix 3 for terrain key).
  (V)  View. Inverses all squares with a line of sight to the
  cursor location.
  (W)  Move cursor to OBJECTIVE AREA (see 4.6) then START LiNE.
  (X)  Exit deployment phase.
  (Y)  Clear units from screen to view terrain.
       (Z)  Examine friendly units at cursor location.
4.5   Unit Deployment Menu:
The unit described at the top of the text Window is the "current unit." 
The following routines may be used to adjust the starting location or inspect 
the status of the current unit:
(1-8)  Move cursor.
  (9)  Change weapon type of armored vehicle.
  (D)  Disembark unit. If unit is a vehicle then it will unload all
  of its passengers; if the unit is a passenger then only that
  unit will unload.
  (E)  Embark unit. Order must be given to a vehicle unit- the
  computer will request the ID of the unit to be embarked.
  (L)  Look for unit. The cursor will move to the unit's location.
  (M)  Move unit. The unit will move to the cursor location.
  (N)  Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the
  current unit.
  (P)  List  passengers.  Will list the units embarked aboard the
  current unit.
  (Q)  Quit the orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
  (V)  View. Inverses all squares that may be seen from the cursor
  location.
  (X)  Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display.
4.6  The Objective Area:
The objective area may be located by pressing the (W) key on the map 
display menu. The cursor will move to the CENTER of the objective area. The 
objective area is a 19 X 19 square area. In some scenarios the players will 
score points for each infantry man, gun or vehicle that ends the game in the 
objective area.
4.7  Saving the Set-Up:
At the conclusion of the deployment phase the computer will allow you 
to save the set-up on a disk initialized for SSI use (disks may be 
initialized at this time).
4.8  Entrenchments:
If the type of battle is a SOVIET ASSAULT or NATO ASSAULT then the 
players may "build" entrenchments for their units. Entrenchments are built by 
moving the cursor over a clear terrain square and pressing the "9" key when 
the computer is in MAP DISPLAY MODE.
Players may build a maximum of 50 entrenchments. Entrenchments may only 
be built on the friendly side of the start line.
4.9  Changing the Map:
During the deployment phase, players may use the U key to create any 
terrain desired on any square of the map. This allows players to create any 
map desired. Move the cursor to the square you wish to change, type U, and 
then type the number of the terrain (see appendix 3 for a list of terrain 
types). When designing a map, keep in mind that often the computer 
intelligence cannot deal with river terrain.
4.10  Changing Weapon Types of Armored Vehicles:
Players wishing to create their own scenarios may change the weapons of 
any of the armored vehicles except halftracks. To change a unit's weapons go 
to the unit orders menu, type "9", and then type the number of the weapon 
desired for the current unit (see section 6.0 for weapon numbers). Warning: 
Aunit's ammunition will not change when a weapon type is changed. Also, use 
caution when changing to or from wepaons that use ATGM's or SAM's. Do not 
change a rifle platoon into another weapon type.
4.11  Visibility Level:
At the beginning of the first turn of each game, the computer will 
randomly determine the visibility level. The visibility level will be set 
between 7 and 20 and will remain constant throughout the game. The visibility 
level is the maximum range at which units may spot and direct fire at enemy 
units.
5.0  ORDERS PHASE
During the orders phase the player(s) may review the status of their 
units and assign movement, bombardment and targeting orders.
5.1  Map Display Menu:
The map display menu used during the orders phase is similar to the one 
used during the deployment phase.
   (1-8)  Move cursor.
(0)  End game.
   (A-U)  Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index number - 
computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU; the selected unit will be the 
"current unit". (If a unit has an index numbe of 10, press the (T) Key).
(V)  View. The computer will inverse all squares that can be seen from 
the cursor location.
(W)  Move cursor to center of objective area.
(X)  Exit orders phase.
(Y)  Clear units and smoke from screen to view terrain.
(Z)  Examine friendly or visible enemy units at cursor location.
5.2   Unit Orders Menu:
Upon selecting a unit from the map menu it will be displayed beneath 
the map showing its composition (number and type of vehicles or weapons), 
ammunition (shown as A, in pulses of firing remaining), facing (shown as a 
compass direction), speed (In movement point rate, it is also miles per   
hour), and whether it's loaded (an L is  displayed when loaded). The 
following routines may be used to assign orders to or inspect the status of 
the current unit:
   (1-8) Move cursor.
(A)* Advance. This command is only used when the computer is in 
all-units mode; the formation HQ will move to the cursor location, other 
units in the formation will move in such a way as to retain their current 
position relative to the HQ.
(B)   Bombard. The cursor location is the target square; the current 
unit is the spotter; the computer will list the artillery units eligible to 
bombard the target (see section 5.6) .
(C)  Center. The map is centered around the cursor.
(D)  Disembark. If the current unit is a vehicle then it will unload 
all of its passengers; if the current unit is a passenger then only that unit 
will unload; unloaded passengers will have a suppression level of 80.
(E)  Embark. Order must be given to a vehicle unit - the computer will 
request the ID of the unit to be embarked (see section 5.4).
(F)* Change unit facing.
(H)  Find unit's HQ. Cursor moves to unit's HQ location; computer 
determines if a "command control" link exists between the current unit and 
the HQ; the HQ becomes the new current unit.
(I)  Inspect. Allows the player to inspect all enemy units that can be 
seen by the current unit; allows the current unit to designate a priority 
target and/or request a bombardment (with the current unit as the spotter). 
Assigning a priority target with the (I)nspect order will cause a range order 
to be given if the target is outside of the set maximum range, with the 
maximum firing range being set equal to the distance to the new target (see 
section 5.8).
(K)* Cancel all orders. Allows the current unit to cancel all movement 
and bombardment orders.
(L)  Look for unit. Moves the cursor to the current unit's location.
(M)* Move unit. Orders the unit to move to the cursor location (see 
section 5.5)
(N)  Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the current 
unit.
(O)  Check movement objectives. Moves the cursor to the movement 
objective location(s) of the current unit; also lists the command control 
delay (see section 5.5).
(P) List passengers. Lists all units embarked aboard the current unit. 
(Q) Quit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(R) Set maximum firing range at which the current unit will select 
targets (see section 5.7).
(S) Set movement speed for the current unit. Helicopter speeds will be 
in increments of 10. This routine will alow helicopters to change altitude 
before setting their speed.
(T)  Inspect the target that the current unit has selected.
(V)  View. The computer will inverse all squares that the current unit 
can see with its current facing.
(X)  Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(Z)  Shift to all-units mode.
5.3   All-Units Mode: Certain orders may be given to all of the units of a 
particular formation. These orders are followed by an "*" In the listing in 
5.2. The computer may be placed in "all-units mode" by pressing the letter 
"A" instead of the unit index number when selecting a unit from the map 
display menu. From the unit orders menu the player may shift to "all-units 
mode " by pressing the (Z) key. EXAMPLE: If the current unit is C4 and the 
(Z) key is pressed, then the computer will shift to all-units mode for 
formation C. C-ALL will be shown at the top of the text window and C0 will 
become the new current unit.
When the computer is in all-units mode then the current unit will 
always be the formation HQ. The computer may not be placed in all-units mode 
if the formation HQ has been destroyed.
5.4   Embarking Units:
All vehicle units may embark infantry type units. Only APC units may 
embark artillery or ATGM type units. Each vehicle may carry a maximum of 10 
transport points. Transport costs for each type of passenger unit are listed 
in the WEAPONS DATA TABLE.
EXAMPLE: A platoon with 30 RIFLEs would require 3 vehicles to transport.
EXAMPLE: A battery of 8 MILAN ATGMs would require 2 APCs to 
transport.
The following command/recon vehicles may be used a s APCs for tranport 
purposes: VAB, BRDM.
After giving the (E)MBARK command the player must enter the ID of the 
unit to be embarked. The embarking unit must be in the same square as the 
vehicle.  It is possible to instruct an APC to embark all of its attached 
units. Type the letter "A" instead of the index number of the passenger unit. 
5.5  Movement Objectives:
Movement objectives may be assigned to the current unit by moving the 
cursor to the desired objective location, pressing the (M) key and then 
entering the desired speed.
Each unit may store up to 2 movement objectives. The FIRST OBJECTIVE 
will always be the first objective assigned and the SECOND OBJECTIVE will 
always be the LAST one assigned. When a unit completes its move to the first 
objective location then the second objective will become the NEW first 
objective. If a new objective is assigned to a unit that already has two 
objectives, then the new objective will replace the old second objective. 
Command control movement delays are imposed each time a new movement 
objective is assigned. Delays are not cumulative; the new delay will replace 
any existing delay.
Movement objectives for the current unit may be reviewed by pressing 
the (O) key. Movement objectives for the current unit may be cancelled by 
pressing the (K) key.
5.6  Requesting Artillery Bombardments:
Indirect fire artillery bombardments may be performed by all mortars, 
off-map artillery, and the German Hummel and Wespe units. Any unit on the map 
may REQUEST a bombardment.
To request a bombardment move the cursor to the desired target square 
and press the (B) key. The computer will list units that are in range and 
capable of performing bombardments. If you wish to assign the displayed unit 
to the bombardment mission press the (B) key. If you wish to skip to the next 
unit without assigning the displayed artillery unit then press the (S) key. 
If you wish to exit the bombardment routine press the (Q) key.
For each artillery unit displayed during the bombardment routine, the 
computer will display the DELAY required before the artillery can start 
firing. The delay is dependent on the relationship between the requesting 
unit and the artillery unit:
(1)  If the requesting unit is an HQ and the artillery unit is part of 
the same formation, then there will be a 2  pulse delay.
(2)  If the requester is a non-HQ but the artillery is part of the same 
formation, then there will be a 4 pulse delay.
(3)  If the requester is the COMMAND HQ, there will be a 4 pulse delay.
If none of the above cases apply, then there will be an 8 pulse delay. 
If more than one of the above cases apply, then the one with the shortest 
delay will be used. Off-map artillery is considered to be in the same 
formation as the COMMAND HQ.
When a unit is ordered to bombard, or when a mortar unit begins to 
fire, the unit's maximum firing range is set to zero. Do not change this 
until the bombardment is completed; otherwise the unit may cancel its 
bombardment.
5.7  Setting Target Selection Range:
Units will automatically select direct fire targets during the combat 
phase. The players may prevent their units from selecting targets at extreme 
ranges by adjusting the unit's target selection range. The target selection 
range may be adjusted by using the (R) routine. All units begin with their 
target selection range set to 0.
EXAMPLE: A T-72 tank unit has its selection range set to 5; the unit 
will only select targets at ranges of 5 or less even though the T-72 weapon 
has a maximum range of 18.
When a unit fires an ATGM, the unit will automatically set its target 
selection range to the weapon's maximum range.
5.8  The Inspect Routine:
The (I)NSPECT routine may be used to review all enemy units that can be 
seen by the current unit. The cursor will move to the position of each 
sighted enemy unit and the player will be allowed to request a bombardment or 
designate the enemy unit as a PRIORITY TARGET for the current unit.
The priority target feature allows the player(s) the option of 
controlling the target selection of their units. If the priority target 
feature is not used then the units will automatically select targets during 
the combat phase.
5.9  Ending the Game:
The player(s) may use the (0) routine on the map display menu to end 
the game at any time. The computer will automatically end the game after turn  
20 for assault scenarios and after turn 15 for all other scenarios. Players 
who wish to continue playing a game beyond its normal limits may do so. If 
you elect not to conitue a game, the computer will reset the game as a 
two-player game in order to allow you to examine both side's units.
5.10  Time:
During the combat phase, 2 minute of actions are resolved. The combat 
phase is divided into 4 PULSES of 30 seconds each,
5.11   Execution Delays:
When units receive new movement or bombardment orders there will be a 
delay, expressed in PULSES, before the orders can be executed (see 5.5, 5.6, 
5.12). Units that use the (K) cancel routine will have a 1-pulse delay added.
5.12   Command Control:
Both players will start with a COMMAND HQ unit. For the Soviets, French 
and British this will be a division unit with a "xx" symbol. For the U.S. and 
West Germans this will be a brigade unit with an "x" symbol).
A unit is considered to be "in command control" if an unbroken "chain 
of command" exists between the unit and the COMMAND HQ. To determine command 
control the computer will examine each link in the chain of command.
To establish a command control link between a non-HQ unit and its 
formation HQ, the unit may not be more than 10 spaces from the HQ. If the 
unit cannot" see"  the HQ, then the maximum distance is 5 spaces.
A command conrol link between a non-HQ and its next higher HQ will 
always exist until one of the units is destroyed.
EXAMPLE: For an infantry platoon to be in command control it would have 
to establish a command control link with its company linked with its 
battalion HQ and the battalion linked with its battalion HQ and the battalion 
HQ would have to be linked to the command HQ.
To determine the chain of command for any unit, use the (H) routine 
from the unit orders menu. Continue pressing the  (H) key until the cursor 
moves to the command HQ.
Units that receive new movement orders will be delayed a number of 
pulses  before they start moving. The length of the  delay varies with the 
command control status of the unit and nationality of the unit. NATO units 
that are "in command control" will have a 1-pulse delay. NATO units that are 
"out of command control" will have a 5-pulse delay. Soviet units that are "in 
command control" will have a 3-pulse delay. Soviet units that are "out of 
command control" will have a 7-pulse delay. Helicopter units never incur 
movement delays.

6.1   Special Infantry Weapons:
All infantry PLATOONS in the game are armed with one of the following 
Special Infantry Weapons (SIWs): LAW, PZF-44, RPG-7. SIWs  will only be used 
when firing at ZERO RANGE against ARMORED VEHICLES. SIWs will be fired 
instead of the platoons' normal RIFLE weapons. When using SIWs, the number of 
weapons firing is equal to NUMBER OF MEN in the platoon divided by 3. When 
SIWs are used, the target unit automatically receives 50% suppression.
7.0  COMBAT PHASE
The combat phase of each turn represents 2 minutes of real time. The 
combat phase is divided into four 30-second pulses. During each pulse units 
may search, select targets, fire their weapons and/or move. Before each       
pulse the computer selects one player's units to move and fire first, with 
each side having a 50% chance of being first each pulse.
7.1 Searching:
At the start of each pulse eligible units will attempt to spot enemy 
units within their "field of vision". The held of vision is determined by the 
unit's facing and its movement status. Moving units have a 90 degree field of 
vision in the direction they are facing. Non-moving units have a 180 degree 
field of vision in the direction they are facing. Flak and ASM units will 
always have a 360 degree field of vision.
The enemy unit will be spotted if (1) It is within the searching unit's 
field of vision, (2) there is an unobstructed line-of-sight and (3) the enemy 
unit is within sighting range.
The  SIGHTING RANGE equals the enemy unit's SL rating plus 1. If the 
enemy unit is in cover terrain then the sighting range is divided by 3. If 
the enemy unit is in "smoke" then the sighting range is divided by 2. If the 
enemy unit is moving then the sighting range is tripled. All sighting range 
adjustments are cumulative. The sighting range may never exceed the 
Visibility Level (set at the start of the game).
    Units that previously selected a target will not search if they are 
still eligible to fire at that target. Units may be unable to search due to 
suppression.
7.2  Selecting Targets:
After searching, a unit will automatically attempt to select a target. 
A target must be a sighted enemy unit that is within target selection range 
(see 5.7). If there is more than one available target then the nearest unit 
will be targeted. If the searching unit has an armor-piercing weapon (MP 
rating greater than 30) then it will select the nearest TANK, if one is in 
range.
Units armed with ATGMs will fire those weapons only at vehicle targets. 
ATGM attacks will be resolved ONE PULSE AFTER they are fired. When a unit 
fires an ATGM, the unit will automatically set its target selection range to 
the weapons' maximum range. if the ATGM launch was sighted by the defending 
unit then the unit will automatically target the firing ATGM unit (but it 
will only return fire if the attacking unit is within the defending unit't 
target selection range). The defending unit will not target the firing ATGM 
if it also has an ATGM.
SAM units may only select heilcopters as target. Flak units may select 
non-helicopter targets if there are no helicopter targets available.
Units will attempt to select another target if their current target is 
an infantry unit with a suppression level of 200 at a range greater than zero 
(in some cases, this can lead units to tmporarily cease fire). A unit will 
automatically change  targets in order to shoot at an enemy unit that enters 
its square.
Once a target has been selected, it will never be lost as a target due 
to a change in the facing of the firing unit.
7. 3   Direct Fire vs. Vehicles and helicopters:
Direct fire may kill or suppress vehicles or helicopters. The 
effectiveness of direct fire is determined by (1) weapon accuracy, (2) the 
number of weapons in the firing unit, (3) shell size, and (4) armor vs. 
penetration. ATGMs may not fire at helicopters.
CANNON AND SAM ACCURACY:
(1) At zero range accuracy will be (90 + (WEAPON ACCURACY x TURNS FIRED 
AT TARGET) )SQUARED/100.
(2) At maximum range accuracy will be (1 + (WEAPON ACCURACY x TURNS 
FIRED AT TARGET) ) SQUARED/100. Weapon accuracy ratings are listed in section 
6.0.
(3) Accuracy is DIVIDED BY 3 if the target unit occupies a TOWN, WOODS 
or ENTRENCHMENT terrain square and has its current speed set to 0. Accuracy 
is not DIVIDED BY 3 when firing at helicopters flying over cover terrain.
(4) If the target unit is moving, then accuracy will be divided by 2 + 
(speed/10).
(6) Accuracy is multiplied times the TARGET SILHOUETTE / 4.
(7)   Accuracy is reduced when firing through cover terrain and/or 
smoke. The accuracy adjustment equals ACCURACY x 2 / (2 + BLOCKING POINTS) . 
Blocking points for cover terrain are: TOWN = 4, WOODS = 2. Blocking points 
for smoke equals the smoke level in the square (0-3) . Cover terrain in the 
attacker s or target's square will not add blocking points. Smoke in the 
attacker's or target s square does add blocking points.
(8) Accuracy is divided by 10 against helicopters unless the firing 
unit is a SAM or Flak unit.
ATGM ACCURACY:
(1) Equals weapon accuracy rating x 2. if firing at a range GREATER 
than the weapon's MINIMUM range then the weapon accuracy rating will be 99. 
firing at a range EQUAL to the weapon's MlNlMUM range then use the accuracy 
rating listed in 6.0.
(2) If the ATGM's suppression is greater than 25 then accuracy will be 
QUARTERED.
(3) Accuracy adjustments 3, 4, 6 and 7 for CANNON weapons also apply to 
ATGMs.
KlLLS:
(1) Armored vehicles are rated for both front and back armor. Front 
armor (FA) protects the front 90 degrees of the vehicle (see diagram). Back 
armor protects the remaining 270 degrees of the vehicle. When firing at a 
range of zero, it is assumed that the fire is directed at the back armor of 
the target.
(2) Weapons are rated for maximum penetration (MP). MP ratings are 
modified by range and shell size (SS) into an ADJUSTED PENETRATlON FACTOR 
(APF). The formula for APF is: ((SS x SS) / 4) + MP - (MP x (RANGE / MAX 
RANGE) /2).
(3) The APF may not exceed 2 x ARMOR.
(4) If the APF is less than 1.25 x ARMOR then the ACCURACY is HALVED. 
If the APF is less than ARMOR then the ACCURACY is HALVED again.
(5) The number of KILLS equals APF x ACCURACY x NUMBER OF WEAPONS 
FlRlNG / (ARMOR x 10O0).
EXAMPLE: Let's assume that 5 M60A3 tanks and 10 T-72 tanks are in clear 
terrain exchanging fire at a range of 6, with each target's front armor 
facing the enemy and a level 2 smoke square in between the two units. The 
ACCURACY of the M60A3's is:
= ((((12 / 18) x 9O) + (5O x 1))squared) / 100
= (110 x 110) / 100
= 121
This accuracy is adjusted by the target silhouette which is 3, so the 
adjusted accuracy is equal to 90.75 (121 x (3 / 4)). Due to the smoke square 
the accuracy is adjusted to 45.30 (90.75 x 2 / (2 + 2)). The APF of the 
M60A3's is:
= ((5 x 5) / 4) + 44 - ((44 x (5 / 18)) /2)
= 25 / 4 + 44 - 110/18
= 44.14
Since the APF is greater than 2 times the armor of the T-72, the APF is 
set to 40 (2 x 20). The number of kills due to the fire of the M60A3 s is:
= 40 x 45.38 x 5 / (20 x 1000)
= .4538
This means that there is roughly a 45.38% chance that one T-72 will be 
destroyed. If the same calculation was made for the fire of the 10 T-72's the 
result would be a kill number of 1.51 which would usually lead to the 
destruction of 1 M60A3 and a 51% chance of the destruction of a second M60A3. 
Due to the large silhouette of the M60A3, and the fact that they are 
out-numbered 2 to 1, an engagement of this type would quickly lead to a NATO 
defeat. If, however, the NATO player had 5 ABRAMS, they would fire with a 
kill number of.454 while the T-72's would fire with a kill number of .368. 
This is a much better situation for the NATO player, although he might still 
need to bring up another platoon of tanks to win the engagement.
7.4   Direct Fire vs. Non-Vehicle Targets:
The effectiveness of direct fire against non-armored targets is 
determined by (1) weapon accuracy, (2) the number of weapons in the firing 
unit, (3) shell size, and (4) target defense strength.
ACCURACY: Calculated the same as cannon accuracy in 7.3 with the 
following exceptions:
(1) When firing at MOVING non-vehicle targets, the accuracy is DOUBLED 
(2) Accuracy is DIVIDED BY 6 if the target is defending in WOODS, TOWN 
or ENTRENCHMENT terrain, irrespective of the unit's current speed setting.
(3) Silhouette ratings do not affect accuracy when firing at 
non-armored targets.
(4) The accuracy is not squared and is not divided by 100.
KlLLS:
(1) Number of KILLS equals SS x SS x ACCURACY x NUMBER OF WEAPONS 
FIRING / (DEFENSE x 100O).
(2)   If the firing unit is in the same square as the target unit and 
the target's suppression level is greater than 99%, then the target will 
defend with a DEFENSE of 1 and the attacker's accuracy is multiplied by 2.
(3) If the firing unit is an armored vehicle and the range is less than 
6 then attacker will add its MG strength to enhance the attack.
7.5   Indirect Fire:
All bombardments and all mortar fire constitute indirect fire. Indirect 
fire will not yield reports of kills and suppression; however, it will report 
when a unit has been eliminated.
The effectiveness of indirect fire is as determined by (1) the view of 
the spotter, (2) shell size, and (3) target defense strength or armor. For 
indirect fire, armored vehicles have ARMOR equal to BACK ARMOR + FRONT ARMOR 
/ 3.
ACCURACY: Calculated the same as 7.3 and 7.4 except for the following:
(1) the range is always considered to be the weapon's maximum range for 
the purpose of calculating accuracy;
(2) the pulses fired at target is equal to zero if the spotter unit 
does not have a line of sight to the target square;
(3) the pulses fired at target is equal to 1 if the spotter unit cannot 
see an enemy unit in the target square;
(4) the pulses fired at target is equal to 4 If the spotter unit can 
see an enemy unit in the target square.
KILLS:  Calculated the same as in 7.3 or 7.4.
Indirect fire attacks each enemy unit in the target square. If a 
friendly unit is present in the target square then the indirect fire mission 
will be canceled immediately.
If the spotter is unable to see the target square, or if there are no 
enemy units in the target square, then the fire will eventually "drift" into 
an adjacent square which will become the new target. Smoke target squares 
will always drift in this manner.
Smoke will never destroy or suppress enemy units in the target square. 
Smoke will inhibit sighting and reduce direct fire accuracy.
Indirect fire will never affect helicopter units.
7.6  Suppression:
Suppression will occur during most direct and indirect fire attacks. 
Non-armored targets may receive up to 200% suppression. Vehicle targets may 
receive a maximum of 50% suppression. If a unit is attacked more than once in 
a pulse then its suppression will be cumulative. Suppression will not occur 
if ATGM weapons fire at armored targets.
The level of suppression added by an attack is equal to (SS x SS x 
ACCURACY x ACCURACY x WEAPONS FIRING) / 200. For suppression purposes the 
ACCURACY wIll always be at least 10.
At the end of each pulse the suppression level of each unit will be 
halved.
7.7  Suppression Effects:
Suppression may affect a unit's ability to search, fire or move. 
SEARCH: Units with greater than 99% suppression may not search. If 
suppression is less than 100% then there is a percentage chance, equal to the 
suppression level, that the unit will fail to search. Units will always 
search the square they occupy.
FIRE: The effectiveness of fire is reduced by 1/3 the level of 
suppression (i.e. a unit with a suppression of 180% will have its fire 
effectiveness reduced bv 180 / 3 or 60%) . In addition, ATGMs will have their 
weapon accuracy rating QUARTERED if suppression is greater than 25.
MOVE: Units with greater than 50% suppression will be pinned down and 
unable to move. Note that armored vehicles will never have greater than 50% 
suppression.
7.8  Ammunition:
Most units will start the game with 40 units of ammunition. Units will 
expend one unit of ammunition each time they fire. Units will be unable to 
fire if their ammunition reaches zero. Specialized ATGM vehicles will carry 
16 missiles. Other ATGM units will carry only 4 missiles. If a vehicle is 
armed with both cannon and ATGM weapons then the computer will account for 
both types of ammunition (only the missiles will be displayed until they have 
been expended after which the cannon or machinegun ammo will be displayed).
Helicopters will carry 4 ATGMs and 16 ammo except for the APACHE which 
carries 16 ATGMs and 16 ammo.
7.9 Movement:
At the end of each pulse, eligible units with movement objectives will 
move. Units that fired ATGMs or indirect fire or were pinned during the pulse 
will not move.
At the end of each pulse, moving units accumulate movement points equal 
to their SP rating (see 6.0). Units will spend movement points to ENTER each 
square on their path. Listed below are the costs to enter each type of 
terrain for each type of unit:
            TRACK    TRUCK     FOOT
clear         13       13       13
road           7        3       10
town          10        5       12
road-slope    10        5       12
entrenchment  20       27       17
woods         20       27       17
slope         20       27       17
ford          30       40       20
All units with SP greater than 12 are TRACKed vehicles. All units with 
SP equal to 12 are WHEELed vehicles. Units with SP less than 12 are FOOT 
units.
Helicopters may enter any type of terrain at a costof 1.3 per square. 
helicopter speeds are displayed in increments of 10. Helicopters flying at 
altitudes less than 2 will have a maximum speed of 9 (90 mph).
The SP rating given to each unit is very close to being equal to the 
unit s maximum miles per hour speed in clear terrain; when setting speed for 
the unit you should consider the SP rating to be equal to miles per hour.
7.10  Disembarking Under Fire :
When vehicles carrying passengers come under fire they may be forced to 
unload during the combat phase. Any vehicle that suffers 1 or more KlLLS must 
immediately unload its passengers. If a vehicle other than an APC suffers 50% 
suppression while carrying infantry then it must immediately unload. If a 
loaded vehicle suffers KILLS then some or all of the passengers may also be 
killed prior to unloading.
7.11  Combat Reports:
During the combat phase the computer will describe the occurrence of 
direct or indirect fire. The computer will report the size and type of shell 
being fired and in most instances the KlLL and/or SUPPRESSlON results. Listed 
below are the criteria for describing the size and type of shell being fired:
      SMALL ARMS FIRE:  RIFLE, CANNON, shell size = 1
 LIGHT ARTILLERY FIRE:  MOR, shell size < 5
MEDIUM ARTILLERY FIRE:  GUN, HOW, MOR, shell size = 5
 HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE:  GUN, HOW, shell size = 6
    LIGHT CANNON FIRE:  CANNON, shell size = 2 or 3
   MEDIUM CANNON FIRE:  CANNON, shell size = 4
    HEAVY CANNON FIRE:  CANNON, shell size > 4
          ATGM LAUNCH:  ATGM launch sighted by defending units
          ATGM ATTACK:  ATGM attack resolution
           SIW ATTACK:  SIW attacking vehicle units
Armored vehicles with an MP rating of zero and an SS rating greater 
than 3 are assumed to be firing HOWitzer or mortar weapons. Armored vehicles 
with an MP rating greater than zero are assumed to be firing CANNON weapons. 
Vehicles with an MP rating of zero and an SS rating of 1 are assumed to be 
firing machine guns.
During direct fire any KILLS or SUPPRESSION will always be displayed. 
During indirect fire KlLLS or SUPPRESSION will not be displayed.
7.12   Sighting Firing Units
Any unit on the map that employs direct or indirect fire has a random 
chance of being sighted. The chance of sighting is equal to 2 x TURNS FIRED 
AT SAME TARGET / RANGE.
7.13 Smoke:
Smoke may be placed by any artillery that is capable of indirect-fire. 
There are three levels of smoke (1-3), with level 1 representing light smoke 
and level 3 representing heavy smoke. Artillery delivered smoke will be at 
level 3 on the turn it is placed. At the end of each pulse there is a random 
chance that the smoke will be reduced one level or removed from the map. 
Listed below are the percentage chances for reducing smoke at each level:
LEVEL 390%
LEVEL 270%
LEVEL 150%
If level 1 smoke is reduced then it will be removed from the map. If a 
vehicle is destroyed in a square that contains no smoke thena level 1 smoke 
will be placed in the square.
If smoke exists in a square then a smoke symbol will appear in the 
square unless the square is occupied by VISlBLE units. If visible units 
occupy a square with smoke in it then the unit symbol will be displayed 
instead of the smoke symbol.
Smoke is considered to have a height of 3 from the base height of the 
terrain in the square. Thus smoke in a level 1/2 forest square would be 
considered to occupy the height levels of 2, 3, and 4 (see section 8).
7.14 Helicopters
Helicopter used in the game have special rules covering their greater 
mobility, and ability to change altitudes. Speed ratings for helicopters are 
listed as multiples of 10 (25 = 250 mph). Each time a helicopter unit changes 
a movement objective or its speed then it will be required to reset its 
altitude level (1-9). The level of altitude (1 level = 5O meters) represents 
the height of the helicopters above the terrain in the same square. Thus a 
helicopter unit flying at level 7 over a level 5/6 town would actually be at 
level 12 (see section 8). Helicopters with their altitude set at 1 will have 
a maximum speed of 9 (90 mph).
Flak and SAM units may fire normally at helicopters; all other units 
have their accuracy divided by 10 when firing at helicopters. Units armed 
with weapons that have a shell size greater than 3 may not fire these weapons 
at helicopters. Instead these units will employ "small arms fire" against the 
helicopters (similar in effect to RIFLE fire). When ground units fire at 
helicopters 1 will be added to the RANGE for every 3 levels of helicopter 
altitude.
8.0 LINE OF SIGHT
The ability of a unit to see another unit on the map is affected by the 
terrain that lies between them. To determine if one unit can observe another 
the computer will follow the procedures listed below:
(1)  Determine the straight line path from the sighting unit to the target 
unit. This path is the "line of sight" (LOS). 
(2) Determine if the range to the target unit is greater than the visibility 
level, in which case the unit cannot be seen.
(3)  Determine if the LOS is blocked (Preventing observation) or clear       
(Permitting observation). If any square on the LOS path contains "blocking" 
terrain then there is a possibility the LOS will be blocked.
(4)  There are two types of blocking terrain: ELEVATED terrain and COVER 
terrain. Elevated terrain is any terrain on the LOS path that has a higher 
altitude level than both the sighting and target units. Cover terrain 
consists of TOWN, WOODS or BROKEN terrain squares.
(5)  Elevated terrain will always block the LOS. Town terrain squares      
will always block a line of sight. A LOS may be traced through 1 woods square 
that would have otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a second 
woods square. A LOS may be traced through 2 broken sguares that would have 
otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a third broken square. A LOS 
may not be traced through one forest and one broken square.
(6)  If the LOS is not blocked and the two units are on the same altitude 
level, then they may observe each other.
(7)  If the LOS is not blocked by ELEVATED terrain and the two units are at 
different altitude levels, then the following formula is used to determine if 
a LOS exists:
LOS is clear if [h - ( d x H / D)] * >= p.
* Rounds off number to nearest integer.
H = height of higher position minus height of lower position.
D = distance from higher position to lower position.
h = height of higher unit.
d = distance from potential obstacle to higher position.
P = height of potential obstacle.
Each square on the path from the higher unit to the lower unit is a 
potential obstacle. Cover terrain will increase the altitude level of a 
square by 1 additional level when  calculating the value of "P"  in the above  
formula. The following diagram shows the  heights of various terrain types on 
a typical map. The computer is the final judge in determining LOS. Players 
may use the  (view key to determine which squares are  visible from any 
particular square).
9.0 HISTORICAL SCENARIOS
9.1 Genera1 Custer Rides Again (FULDA May 8, 199O)
This is a Soviet pursuit with a game length of 15 turns. The NATO 
player begins with 250 victory points, and the Soviet player begins with 1 
victory point. On the border of the two Germanys, 25 kilometers west of 
Fulda, elements of an American armored cavalry regiment defend against an 
early morning Russian attack. Like General Custer before him, the American 
cavalry commander gives the command "take no prisoners."
9.2   Hold the Line (WURZBURG May 11, 199O)
This is a Soviet assault with a game length of 20 turns. The NATO 
player begins with 1 victory point, and the Soviet player begins with 1 
victory point. Just northeast of Wurzburg, the 1st mech battalion of the 3rd 
mech division deploys in a defense in depth in order to gain time for the 
coming Reforger units, for the longer the delay, the stronger NATO becomes. 
The time has come to hold the line.
9.3   The Tide Begins to Turn  (KARLSRUHE May 25, 1990)
This is a NATO assault with a game length of 20 turns. The NATO player 
begins with 1 victory point, and the Soviet player begins with 2 victory 
points. Soviet forces advance on the Rhine at Karlsruhe, only to be faced 
with a counterattack that begins to encircle them from Stuttgart and 
Heidelberg. As Part of the counterattack, a West German armored battalion 
reinforced with supporting U.S. Apache helicopters lunges east from Karlsruhe 
at a startled soviet mechanized spearhead.
9.4   Into the Jaws (OLDENBORG May 26, 199O)
This game is a meeting engagement with a game length of 15 turns. The 
NATO player begins with 1 victory point, and the Soviet player begins with 1 
victory point. A hodgepodge of units from the British 24th brigade were sent 
from England to reinforce Bremen, but at the last moment they were redirected 
to engage a recon unit of a Soviet motorized rifle division which had broken 
through and was threatening to capture Oldenburg and cut off NATO forces in 
Bremen.
9.5 After Action Reports
Fulda - The Soviets broke through at Hilders after suffering severe 
losses. The cavalry commander's widow was notified at 1243 hours.
Wurzburg - American forces took heavy losses but delayed the Soviets 
long enough to allow NATO to regroup for the coming counterattack.
Karlsruhe - West German forces spearheaded the first major NATO attack. 
Despite taking large losses, the Soviets are being driven back.
Oldenburg - The Brits, suffering near fatal losses, are reorganizing at 
this very moment after repulsing a concerted Soviet attack.

10.0 GAME LENGTH AND VICTORY CONDITIONS
10.1  Ending the Game:
The game will automatically end after 20 turns (30 turns if an assault 
battle is being played). Players may also elect to end the game early if they 
both agree (use the 0 key), and they may also elect to continue a game that 
has ended. If they elect to continue a game that has ended, the computer will 
never again end the game as this must be done by the players.
10.2  Victory Conditions:
At the end of the game victory points (VPs) will be awarded as follows:
EACH UNUSED SELECTION POINT........................20
  (maximum of 250 due to unused selection points)
FORCES IN THE OBJECTIVE AREA:
  ARMORED VEHICLE..................................20
  ARTILLERY/TRUCK..................................10
  INFANTRYMAN.......................................5
EACH KILL:
  INFANTRY.............................TRANSPORT COST
  ARMORED VEHICLE..................................10
   (Plus FRONT ARMOR)
Only the attacking player receives points for units in the objective 
area. When playing a meeting engagement type battle both players receive 
points for units in the objective area (both players are considered to be the 
attacker).
After the victory points have been totaled the defender's points will 
be doubled (points for unused selection value may be doubled to a value no 
greater than 500).
The computer will divide the total NATO victory points by the total 
SOVIET victory points to arrive at a victory ratio. Compare this ratio to the 
following chart to determine the victor:
2.00 and above ..NATO Decisive Victory
1.50 - 1.99 .....NATO Substantive Victory
1.10 - 1.49 .....NATO Marginal Victory.
0.92 - 1.09 .....Draw
0.67 - 0.91 .....SOVIET Marginal Victory
0.51 - 0.66 .....SOVIET Substantive Victory
0.50 and below ..SOVIET Decisive Victory
12.0  STRATEGY NOTES
Deployment
When deploying on defense you should entrench your infantry near the 
forward edge of the objective area in company size positions. Position your 
ATGMs and some of your armored vehicles behind this line by several squares. 
Place your mortars, artillery and main HQ behind your lines near the edge of 
the board, perferably accompanied by several SAM and flak units. Place you 
artillery observers 5-10 squares behind the infantry on hilltops which have 
clear fields of vision of probable approaches. You are attempting to create a 
situation in which enemy tanks first encounter your infantry positions, and 
then almost simultaneously receive ATGM and heavy anti-tank fire. Try to keep 
at least one company of tanks in reserve, committing them only once the axis 
of the main enemy attack is determined. When attacking place your infantry in 
APCs and set up in a tight formation no more than 5-10 squares wide. Consider 
splitting off a task force of one tank company and one infantry company (or 
even better a helicopter squadron) to flank the enemy defensive positions.
Command Control.
Be sure to protect your main HQ by placing it in the rear, but keep it 
on a hilltop if possible so that it can call in artillery fire with a minimum 
delay if your forward observers are eliminated. Keep your HQ units 1-2 
squares behind the units they are commanding. Highlevel HQ's such as Soviet 
and British tank regiment HQ's and all infantry battalion HQ's should only be 
committed to combat when absolutely necessary.
Firing on the Move
In Mech Brigade, units can fire while moving, although with greatly 
reduced accuracy. If you wish to fire with full ability while taking 
advantage of cover terrain in the unit's square, but you also want to keep 
the unit's current movement objective, set the units speed to 0. Even if you 
dont want to keep the current movement objective, it is better to set the 
speed to 0 than to use the (K)cancel command, since the cancel command will 
eliminate any pulses fired at target that may already have accumulated. 
APC's, Infantry, and Smoke
Never allow moving infantry to be spotted by enemy forward observers. 
Artillery is much too powerful against moving infantry to allow this. Always 
move your infantry forward in APC's, only dismounting when you are within 
small arms range of the defending forces. Use of smoke to cover infantry 
assaults is essential. Concentrate on shielding your units from probable 
observer positions.
Smoke
Smoke can be used to separate the defending force into many small 
pieces, each to be destroyed piecemeal. On defense, smoke can be used to 
block those attacking units that have stopped to provide covering fire for 
the moving attackers. The problem with smoke is that you need a lot of it due 
to the lack of control of its scattering and its quick dissipation. But don't 
forget that although you can see through low levels of smoke, fire accuracy 
will still be significantly reduced.
Weapons
At least 50% of the strategy in Mech Brigade is derived from the 
differences between weapons systems. It is essential that you study your 
weapons when beginning a scenario, as well as attempt to predict which 
weapons you will face. Try to establish at what range you will attempt to 
engage enemy tanks. For example if you have T-72 tanks and expect to face 
Abrams tanks, it would be foolish to close to 1600 yards, stop and exchange 
fire. The sound strategy would be to close to within at most 1000 yards 
before stopping to fire. The key is understanding under what conditions your 
weapons have an acceptable chance of defeating the enemy.
Helicopters
Helicopters have three major functions. They can be used to recon enemy 
positions, as they are especially useful at sighting eneny attacking columns. 
They can be used ot fly around enemy positions in order to destroy artillery 
units andHQ's hiding in rear areas. They can also be used as tank hunting 
systems, first destroy1ng enemy SAM and flak units and then taking their time 
eliminating large numbers of helpless enemy vehicles. If you expect Your 
opponentto use helicopters, it is wise to purchase extra anti-aircraft units 
(you will need them).
Speciat Infantry Weapons
Infantry defending in cover terrain cannot be seen until either an 
enemy unit enters its square or the infantry unit opens fire. For this reason 
it is often wise to set the target selection range of defending infantry to 
zero. This will allow the infantry to ambush enemy units that enter its 
square. The weakness of this strategy is that each defenaing square, once 
discovered, can be attackea piecemeal. When attacking against the 0 range 
strategy, it is best to send infantry one square ahead of the attacking 
tanks, as it is much better to have your infantry ambushed than your tanks. 
If you don't have time for a slow infantry advance, be sure to put infantry 
on your tanks (or in accompanying APC's), for if your tanks are ambushed, at 
least your infantry will dismount and fire back in defense of the tanks. 
Suppression
In Mech Brigade, once a unit has been fully suppresses (100+), it may 
easily be destroyed by a unit entering its square. The key is to identify 
soft-targets, keep them suppressed, and then send in at least one unit to 
close assault the defender. Using small arms and artillery fire to suppress 
armored vehicles can also be useful, as it can help keep the vehicles from 
acquiring new targets.
The Combined Arms Concept
Mech Brthade rewards those who are able to use combined arms tactics. 
On the attack, artillery should be used to cover the advance with smoke, 
suppress enemy infantry and ATGM teans, and help suppress enemy vehicles. 
Infantry is needed to suppress and then assault defending infantry positions, 
ad well as help in suppressing enemy vehicle's. Tanks can be usea to destroy  
enemy vehicle's and overrun suppressed eneny infantry and ATGM positions. 
Recon vehicle's and light tanks should be positioned several squares ahead of 
the assault elements in order to spot enemy positions and draw fire from 
non-armor weapons, thus exposing them to your counterfire. On defense, use 
infantry to ambush tanks and suppress any units that come too close. 
Artillery. can be usea to keep attacking infantry pinned down. While ATGM 
systems attack vehicles that are mixing it up with the defending infantry. 
Tanks should be used as a mobile' reserve, fighting off major armored thrusts 
or conunter attacking unsupported infantry attacks.
