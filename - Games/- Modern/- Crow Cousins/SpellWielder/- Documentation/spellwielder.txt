BASIC WISDOM

Joystick Controls ​ The joystick can be used for movement. Button 0
fires the current magic spell. Button 1 switches spells (assuming you
have more than one). To switch to joystick mode, refer to "Other
Important Keyboard Controls" below.  (keyboard is default but I'm
leaning towards making joystick the default. Let me know what you
think!)

Keyboard Controls 

A,S ​ 				Decrease / Increase the currently selected spell

<SPACE>				Fire the current spell

I, J, K ​M/?		Move the player up, left, right, or down, respectively. If the <TAB>
					key is pressed once, movement will be continuous. If <TAB> is pressed
					again, movement will be step by step. This can be very useful in tight
					situations. The "?" key is used as an alternative for the downward
					direction on AZERTY keyboards which position this key under the I,J,K
					combination. ​ 
					
Other Important Keyboard Controls (Available At All Times): 

<RETURN> ​			Speak - Used to answer riddles, questions, etc. ​

1					Flip between keyboard (default) and joystick modes

5					Enable or disable (default) Mockingboard music -- There is a small CPU
					penalty when the music is playing

6					Enable (default) or disable the "lazy drive spindown" feature. This is
					used to keep disk access times down and minimize impacts to the music
