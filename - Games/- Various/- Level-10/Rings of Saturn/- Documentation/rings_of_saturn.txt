Object is to make it to a gap in the rings of Saturn to rescue people at
a stranded ship about to blow up.  Blast your way through the rings to
get there, slow down when you approach the ship (get within 10-30 km
then stop, press ESC to launch your shuttle), pick up the survivors, and
get back to base (same routine as pickup here).

ESC leaves the title screen.
Numbers 1-9 change the MPS speed, 0 to stop.
V toggles the view screen (one is looking forward, the other looking
back as you travel).
N toggles 'noises' (sound on/off) P pauses, until you move the joystick.
S toggles shields, L-long range scan viewer.

CTRL key plus these build a repair robot
C-Communications E-Engines
L-Long range viewer S-Shields T-Tracking

When you're in the 'game over' screen, where 'G' will start a new game,
entering Ctrl-] will display the name of the programmer, Daniel Minardi.
