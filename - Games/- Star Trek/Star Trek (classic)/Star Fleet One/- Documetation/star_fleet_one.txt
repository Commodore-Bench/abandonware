SHIELD INFORMATION :

There are two SHIELD DISPLAYS -- In the upper right corner of 
the screen is a graphic display of your ship and its shields.  
Below  that  is an energy distribution  display  showing  the 
total amount of energy and how it is distributed through your 
ship and shields. (shld1/shld2/shld3/shld4) 
NOTE:   All shields are referenced to your bearing.   If your 
ship  is pointing north,  then shield 1 will be facing  north 
shield 2 will be facing west, etc.

COMPASS HEADINGS :

EAST 		= 0 DEGREES
NORTHEAST 	=  45 DEGREES
NORTH		= 90 DEGREES
NORTHWEST	 = 135 DEGREES
WEST 		= 180 DEGREES
SOUTHWEST 	= 225 DEGREES
SOUTH 	= 270 DEGREES
SOUTHEAST = 315 DEGREES

The  PATROL AREA MAP is made up of 64 (8x8  grid)  quadrants.  
Each  quadrant  is  defined  by its  location  in  the  grid.  
Quadrant "3,2" means row 3, column 2, counting from the upper 
left corner.   Once scanned or probed a quadrant will display 
three numbers: (1) the number of enemy ships,(2) ID number of 
the  starbase if present and (3) the number of star  systems.  
Zeros mean none exist and "?" means the quadrant hasn't  been 
checked out.
EXAMPLE:  Quadrant "3,2" has two enemy ships, starbase #5 and 
two star systems.

The QUADRANT AREA MAP is made up of 100 (10x10 grid)  sectors 
and is always displayed as a tactical map with visible  items 
in that quadrant.   Sectors are defined in the same manner as 
quadrants (by row, column).

<<< STARFLEET I - COMMANDS >>>

A command menu is located at the bottom of your display.  You 
may choose a command by hitting the appropriate number key (1 - 0) 
or by clicking the mouse on the command location.   Your selection 
may lead you to a second command menu.   Hitting the ESC key  will 
usually  cancel a command or get you out of a  sub-menu.   Hitting 
the RETURN key may be necessary to activate certain procedures  if 
you are not using the mouse.

* COMMANDS *

TAR :  ( P-1 )

TARGET CALCULATOR >
Computes the bearing and distance from your starship to  any 
point  in  the region.   Move the mouse cursor and  click  on  the 
target quadrant.  Now choose the target sector in the same manner.  
You may also choose the quadrant and sector by typing the row  and 
column  numbers  separated  by  a  comma.    TAR  will  make   all 
navigational  calculations  and allows you to abort  or  fire  the 
engines.

LRS :  ( P-2 )

LONG RANGE SENSORS >
Causes  the  contents  of  the  quadrants  surrounding  your 
starship to be displayed on the Region Map.

STA :  ( P-3 )

MISSION STATUS REPORT >
Gives information on the current status of your mission  and 
any alien vessels in your quadrant.

DAM :  ( P-4 ) 

DAMAGE CONTROL >
Allows  you to list the status of your  ship's  systems  and 
repair  those  that  are damaged.   If any  of  your  systems  are 
damaged,  you  will  be asked if you would like to repair  one  of 
them.   If  you  answer <Y> then the system # will  be  asked  for 
followed by the amount of energy you wish to use in repair.

NAV :  (P-5)

NAVIGATIONAL CONTROL >
Allows you to move,  either within your current quadrant  or 
between quadrants.  You must input COURSE and C-FACTOR (distance - 
.1 per sector) values before you can fire your engine.
NOTE:  It is much easier to use TARGET CALCULATOR!

SHD :  ( P-6 )

DEFENSIVE SHIELDS CONTROL >
Allows you to adjust your defensive shields.   Each time  you  
are  hit,  the number of units of the hit are subtracted from  the 
shield facing the enemy.   If the shield is penetrated, damage and 
casualties  will occur.   The maximum capacity of your shields  is 
4000  units  of energy - with no shield  over  2000.   A  sub-menu 
appears from which you choose your shield configuration.

(1) LOWER -- lower all shields to zero. 
(2) BATTLE -- doubles power to front shield, with none in the rear,
		    and leaves at least 100 units in reserve.
(3) MAX -- allocates available power evenly to all shields and leaves 
		at least 100 units in reserve.
(4) TOTAL -- you choose total amount to be allocated.
		 All shields receive equal amounts.
(5) INDIVIDUAL -- you input amount to each individual shield.

TOR :  ( P-7 )

TORPEDO CONTROL >
Allows you to fire torpedoes.   You first choose (1) AUTO  or 
(2) MANUAL.  AUTO will determine the number of targets in view and 
ask  for  the number of torpedoes (5 max.) to  be  fired.   MANUAL 
allows you to fire your torpedoes at any location in the quadrant.
You normally begin with 20 torpedoes but you can carry up to 30.

PHA :  ( P-8 )

PHASER CONTROL >
Allows you to fire your ship's phasers (6 max.).  Phasers are 
more  effective  at  close range and may be  used  to  destroy  or 
disable the enemy.   Phasars will also wrap around objects such as 
star systems.  AUTO will automatically select target locations and 
give you the option of disabling or destroying the enemy.   MANUAL 
requires additional input before firing.

CMP :  ( P-9 )

SHIP'S COMPUTER >
Allows you to access the computer on-board your  ship.   The 
COMPUTER MENU will appear on the bottom line of the display.

2ND :  ( P-0 )

SECONDARY MENU >
Allows you to access the SECONDARY MENU on the bottom line of 
the screen display.

TRC : ( S-1 )

TRACTOR BEAM CONTROL >
Activates your ship's tractor beam for placing disabled enemy 
vessels in tow.  Your tractor beam cannot operate through a shield 
so the shield facing the disabled ship must be lowered.

HINT:   If  the SHIELD CONTROL is damaged and you need to lower  a 
shield to gain energy you may “use your tractor beam to lower  your 
shield.

TRN :  ( S-2 )

TRANSPORTERS CONTROL >
Activates your ship's transporters to transport  your  space 
marines into a disabled enemy vessel.   It may take more than  one 
boarding to capture the vessel.

MIN :  ( S-3 )

MINE CONTROL >
Allows  you  to lay torpedoes as mines  and  retrieve  them.  
Mines  are most useful to damage or destroy single enemy  vessels, 
especially Zaldrons.   As your starship moves it leaves a mine  in 
each sector you pass through,  until the allocated number has been 
laid.   If you leave the quadrant all mines not retrieved will  be 
lost.   Mines cannot be laid if you have a ship in tow.  Mines can 
be  retrieved after visiting a starbase (increasing the total  you 
are allowed to carry).

SEC :  ( S-4 ) 

INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROL >
Allows  you to use your ship's internal  security  force  to 
apprehend  intruders.   You  may  choose  between  SEARCH  or  MAX 
options.   If MAX is chosen,  you will be asked the deck on  which 
you wish to conduct the maximum search.

SAV : ( S-5 ) 

SAVE GAME OPTION >
This option allows you to save your game in progress.   A TOS 
window will appear and you will type in a file name to store  your 
game.

STO :  ( S-6 )

STOP GAME OPTION >
This option allows you to stop your mission  without  saving 
it.   Missions that are stopped do not become part of your service 
record.

SND :  ( S-7 ) 

SOUND OPTION >
This option allows you to toggle the game sounds on/off.

PRO :  ( C-1 ) 

PROBE LAUNCH CONTROL >
Allows  you to launch deep space reconnaissance  probes  for 
exploring remote quadrants in your region.   This task allows  you 
to  launch three probes per mission.   Both the course and  launch 
power must be input.  Approximately 80 units of power is enough to 
send a probe across the diagonal length of your region.

AAS :  ( C-2 )

AUTO ALERT SWITCH >
This command toggles the AUTO ALERT SWITCH on/off.   When  in 
the ON position your shields are automatically raised and  lowered 
to meet with conditions.

NOP :  ( C-3 )

NO OPERATIONS OPTION >
This  option allows a mission time cycle to  elapse  without 
doing any operations.

BAS :  ( C-4 )

STARBASE STATUS REPORT >
Gives you the current status of your starbases.   The  report 
gives  you  the  quadrant  location,   strength,   remaining  crew 
replacements, and status for each known starbase.

HYP :  ( C-5 )

EMERGENCY HYPERSPACE MANEUVER >
Activates your Emergency Hyperspace Control to relocate  your 
ship at random in the region.   This task permits your starship to 
enter hyperspace,  usually to escape hopeless situations and is  a 
very dangerous maneuver.

SLF :  ( C-6 )

SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCER >
Destroys  your starship and all vessels  in  your  quadrant.  
This is to be used only as a last resort.

***  GENERAL INFORMATION  ***


THE ENEMY

There are two races of hostile aliens - the Krellans and  the 
Zaldrons.   The  destroyer  is  the  only  type  of  Krellan  ship 
identified so far by Star Fleet Intelligence.   Even less is known 
about the warships used by the Zaldron.   Star Fleet has not  been 
able to determine the Zaldron ship's class or type, although it is 
similar in size to a destroyer.

Krellans  are classified  as  warm-blooded  humanoids.   The 
Krellan  people  as a race are extremely hostile  and  aggressive.  
Their  physical strength is greater than most inhabitants  of  the 
galaxy,  including  humans.   Their  aggressive behavior  and  raw 
courage are the product of centuries of selective breeding.  Their 
society is based on conquest.  Krellan children are selected at an 
early  age  for  their future  career.   All  parents  hope  their 
children  will  be  selected to be part of  the  Imperial  Krellan 
assault forces.   If not,  they will grow up in the working class, 
laboring  all their lives to support the Empire with  little  gain 
for  themselves.    All  political,   medical,   and  upper  class 
occupations are held by military officials.   A Krellan's life  is 
made up of war and conquest;  this is their honor.   For a Krellan 
to die in battle is the greatest honor of all.

Zaldrons are subterranean dwellers.   They are  cold-blooded 
reptiloids.    However,   they  are  extremely  intelligent.   The 
Zaldrons are an imperialistic race,  but unlike the Krellans, they 
are  not  overly  aggressive.   Their  battles  are  strategically 
planned  and executed.   Meticulous precision is a  characteristic 
trait of the Zaldron.   The Zaldrons serve a Queen,  and in  their 
society  the  females  serve  in all  political  and  upper  class 
occupations.  This frees their males for war.


ENEMY TACTICS


Krellan movement depends on your mission level.   For  level 
one  games they will not move at all.   For level two  games  they 
will move only within your current quadrant.   For level three and 
above the Krellans will move within your current quadrant and also 
from quadrant to quadrant within the region.   There movement  can 
be detected within the explored quadrants of your region by  using 
long range sensors and watching the region map.   The fewer  there 
are  and the higher your rank,  the more likely they are to  move.  
It is important to know the current location of the enemy.   Using 
the  region map you can see if a starbase is about to  come  under 
attack,  or see if you need to change your strategy and head to  a 
different  part of the region to attack a higher concentration  of 
enemy forces.  The only known strategy of the Krellan attackers is 
that  they  tend  to  gather in  and  near  quadrants  where  your 
starbases are located.

There  will be up to five Krellans in  each  quadrant.   The 
Zaldron  warships  operate individually and can enter or  leave  a 
quadrant at will,  but there will only be one hostile Zaldron in a 
quadrant  at  a time.   The Zaldron ships are  normally  invisible 
because  of their invisibility screens.   Their presence  in  your 
quadrant can be detected by your sensors due to their  disturbance 
of the space-time continuum,  but their exact position is  usually 
only  determined by accidentally colliding with or shooting  them.  
However,   the  warping  of  the  space-time  continuum  by  their 
invisibility screen uses tremendous energy and it is difficult  to 
maintain in a stable condition.   Consequently,  your short  range 
sensors may occasionally detect a slight disturbance,  which  will 
appear  as  a  momentary flicker on the Tactical  Display  of  the 
sector  containing the Zaldron.   Since the Zaldrons use  so  much 
energy  to stay invisible,  if they remain in your  quadrant  long 
enough, they will get so weak that they will become visible and be 
unable to move.

Each enemy vessel will shoot at your starship each time  one 
of the following happens:

1. Your starship enters a new quadrant
2. Your starship moves
3. Your starship fires phasers or torpedoes
4. You operate the tractor beam or transporters

Also,  if an entire day goes by without the enemy firing  at 
you,  they will fire at you anyway, just out of spite.  The closer 
the enemy is to your starship,  the stronger the hit will be, with 
a maximum of 475 units for Krellans or 575 units for Zaldrons when 
in a sector next to yours.   When you damage an enemy vessel,  its 
strength  is weakened and cannot be regained unless your  starship 
leaves the quadrant.   However, once you leave their quadrant they 
will rapidly recharge their energy to full strength.

You  need  not eliminate all the enemy  vessels  (either  by 
destroying or capturing them) in your region.   There will  always 
be  more enemy ships in the region than are necessary to  complete 
your mission.


YOUR SERVICE RECORD 

Your promotion history and any awards or decorations you have 
received are contained in the service record.  Your service record 
is  updated automatically by the program at the end of each  game.  
To  be promoted you must complete the required number of  missions 
with  an  overall  efficiency rating of  75%.   You  will  not  be 
promoted after a failed mission,  even if your overall  efficiency 
rating  is above 75%.   You must successfully complete  your  last 
mission in order to be promoted.


STAR FLEET SECURITY SYSTEM

To protect your STAR FLEET I simulation against  unauthorized 
use  by  enemy agents and other undesirable  sentient  being,  two 
levels of security have been installed.   The first appears  after 
the title and credit screens have been shown,  and requires you to 
enter  a certain word obtained from the Officer's Manual  per  the 
instructions given on your screen. 

The  second level of security (a  password)  prevents  other 
authorized  Fleet  members from signing on under  your  name.   If 
signing on for the first time,  input your name and a  "password".  
DO NOT FORGET YOUR NAME AND PASSWORD!!   If you do forget you will 
have to begin again at Star Fleet Academy.


ENEMY INTRUDERS

Enemy intruders are dastardly aliens who come aboard and  run 
amok in your ship sabotaging systems.   There are three sources of 
intruders:   a Krellan or Zaldron agent who is transported  aboard 
through  a  lowered defensive shield,  a Krellan agent  who  slips 
aboard while you are docked with starbase, or an escaped prisoner.  
There will only be one intruder aboard at a time.

Intruders  are first located when they  sabotage  a  system, 
which can occur on any deck (1 to 20).  The intruder may then work 
his way up or down through the decks,  but can only move one  deck 
at  a  time.   You  can use the Maximum Security  Deck  option  of 
Security Control to try and intercept the intruder as he works his 
way towards vulnerable systems.   Intruders do not appear in level 
one or two games.


SHIP DISABLED


You can also lose the game by having your ship  disabled  as 
well as destroyed.  The following will disable your ship:

(1) ALL POWER EXPENDED 
(2) BOTH LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS DESTROYED
(3) BACKUP LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM BATTERIES EXHAUSTED
(4) ENTIRE SHIP'S CREW KILLED (500)


STARBASES AND DOCKING


Resupply  and repairs are provided by  means  of  starbases.  
These  starbases  are dispersed throughout  Alliance  space.   For 
security  reasons,  all starbase locations are kept  secret  until 
attacked; thus, you will have to find them yourself.

To dock with a starbase, you must move to an adjacent sector.  
However,  you  cannot dock using main engines and you cannot  dock 
immediately  after entering the quadrant.   If your move into  the 
quadrant  puts  you next to starbase,  just use  your  maneuvering 
engines to dock.

Upon docking,  all damaged systems are repaired,  all  power 
replenished,   crew   replacements  obtained  and  torpedoes   are 
replaced.    However,  probes  and shuttlecraft are not  replaced.  
Starbase  also provides a security force to assist yours if  there 
is  an intruder aboard.   While docked,  starbase's  shields  will 
protect  your  ship,  but if starbase is destroyed while  you  are 
docked,  you  too will be destroyed.   You can fire torpedoes  and 
phasers, use your tractor beam, transporters, etc., while docked.

If  you are not present in the quadrant and  a  starbase  is 
attacked  you  will  receive a message  from  Star  Fleet  Command 
ordering  you to rescue.   You will also receive messages  if  the 
starbase is critical or has been destroyed.  The successful rescue 
of  a  starbase will increase your rating,  while a  failure  will 
decrease  it.   You  will not be credited for a rescue  until  all 
hostile  ships  in the quadrant have  been  eliminated,  including 
Zaldrons.   You can deliver an enemy vessel in tow without docking 
by maneuvering next to starbase.   When asked if you wish to dock, 
respond  "no" and you will be asked if you want to  deliver  enemy 
ship.


THE TIME FACTOR

Next to the MET (Mission Elapse Time) number of days in  the 
upper right of your screen is a symbol indicating how well you are 
doing for time.   An UP ARROW means you are ahead in time.  ARROWS 
UP  AND DOWN mean you are close in time and DOWN ARROW  means  you 
are behind in time.   TIME WARNING = 5 days left.  TIME CRITICAL = 
2 days left.
