Galactic Attack is a 1980 video game written by Robert Woodhead for the
Apple II and published by the company he co-founded, Sirotech. Sirotech
would soon thereafter be renamed to Sir-Tech. It is a single-player
adaptation of the game Empire from the PLATO mainframe network to the
much smaller non-networked environment of a standalone 8-bit
microcomputer.

Sir-Tech followed-up Galactic Attack with the far more commercially
successful game Wizardry, which was an adaptation and evolution of PLATO
system dungeon crawl games, in particular Oubliette and Moria.
