Lemonade Stand is a business simulation game created in 1973 by Bob
Jamison of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC). In
1979, the game was ported by Charlie Kellner to the Apple II; Apple
subsequently included the game with their computers throughout the
1980s.

Reviewers of the game, both contemporary and retroactive, viewed the
game as a good primer for children with regard to business and
decision-making processes.
