Galactic Empire is a strategy video game written by Doug Carlston for
the TRS-80 in 1979. It is the first game in the Galactic Saga and became
first game published by Brøderbund which was, in fact, created for the
purpose of publishing the game. Galactic Empire was ported to the Apple
II and the Atari 8-bit family and followed by three sequels. The game
was also published by Adventure International.

Broderbund was founded by brothers Doug and Gary Carlston in 1980 for
the purpose of marketing Galactic Empire. Their sister, Cathy, joined
the company a year later. Broderbund is best known for the 8-bit
computer game hits Choplifter, Lode Runner, Karateka, and Prince of
Persia (all of which originated on the Apple II), as well as The Print
Shop—originally for printing signs and banners on dot matrix
printers—and the Myst and Carmen Sandiego games.
