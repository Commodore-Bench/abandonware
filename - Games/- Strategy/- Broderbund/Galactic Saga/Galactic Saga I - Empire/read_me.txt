Galactic Empire is a strategy video game written by Doug Carlston for
the TRS-80 in 1979. It was the first game published by Brøderbund which
was, in fact, created for the purpose of publishing the game. Galactic
Empire was ported to the Apple II and the Atari 8-bit family and
followed by three sequels. The game was also published by Adventure
International.

Brøderbund is best known for the computer game hits Choplifter, Lode
Runner, Karateka, and Prince of Persia (all of which originated on the
Apple II), as well as The Print Shop—originally for printing signs and
banners on dot matrix printers—and the Myst and Carmen Sandiego games.
