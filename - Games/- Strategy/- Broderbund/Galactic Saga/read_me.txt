Galactic Empire is a strategy video game written by Doug Carlston for
the TRS-80 in 1979. It was the first game published by Br√∏derbund which
was, in fact, created for the purpose of publishing the game. Galactic
Empire was ported to the Apple II and the Atari 8-bit family and
followed by three sequels. The game was also published by Adventure
International.
