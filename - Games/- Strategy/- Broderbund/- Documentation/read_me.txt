Brøderbund was founded by brothers Doug and Gary Carlston in 1980 for
the purpose of marketing Galactic Empire. Their sister, Cathy, joined
the company a year later. Brøderbund is best known for the 8-bit
computer game hits Choplifter, Lode Runner, Karateka, and Prince of
Persia (all of which originated on the Apple II), as well as The Print
Shop—originally for printing signs and banners on dot matrix
printers—and the Myst and Carmen Sandiego games.
