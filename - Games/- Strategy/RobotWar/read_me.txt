RobotWar is a programming game written by Silas Warner. This game, along
with the companion program RobotWrite, was originally developed in the
TUTOR programming language on the PLATO system in the 1970s. Later the
game was commercialized and adapted for the Apple II family of computers
and published by Muse Software in 1981.

The main activity of the game is to write a computer program that
operates a (simulated) robot. The player selects multiple robots which
do battle in an arena until only one is left standing. The robots do not
have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other
robots; they only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use
clever programming techniques to deduce velocity.

RobotWar was a multiplayer game as different people could program their
robots, then copy all the robots' source codes to the same floppy disk
and load all the robots to fight in the arena.
