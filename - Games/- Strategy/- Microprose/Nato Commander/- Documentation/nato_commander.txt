News Summary (April 21-30)
==========================

UPI...Brussels: The new NATO commander was sworn in today in a 
brief ceremony.

AP...Wittenberge: The East German labour movement claims that the workers
in the border town of Wittenberge are on strike. Reports from West German
sources indicate that large numbers of refugees are crossing the border in
the vicinity. East Germany today accused the West German Government of
supplying food and weapons to the striking workers.

REUTERS...Franfurt: NATO forces have been placed on Alert Level 3 and all
leaves have been cancelled. Tension along the East German border has
increased as a result of the West German government's recent support of
the dissident East German labour movement.

REUTERS...Moscow: The USSR threatened today to crush the labour revolt by
force if necessary. It warned the West German government not to interfere
with the "internal affairs" of a Warsaw Pact country.

AP...Wittenberge: East German dissident announced the beginning of talks with
the West German government aimed at the reunification of the two Germanies.
The West German government refuses to confirm or deny the existence of
these talks.

REUTERS...Berlin: All access routes to the city of Berlin have been closed by
the East German Government. American and British outposts report contact with
Russian mechanized forces. The Soviet government refused to acknowledge the
outbreak of hostilities but noted that "appropriate measures" were being 
taken.


Situation Briefing (April 30) To: Incoming NATO Commander
=========================================================

NATO forces in Central Region consist of 24 divisions and supporting assets
from the US, West German, British, Dutch, and Belgian armies. In addition a
number of French divisions should become available if war breaks out. The
Warsaw Pact had deployed over thirty divisions from East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, and the USSR along the East German border. An additional 
fifty divisions are available from the WP strategic reserve in Poland and
the USSR. Therefore the initial priority in any conflict with WP forces must
be to hold back the attack until NATO reserves can be assembled and NATO 
air superiority can be established.


NATO Order of Battle
====================

US V Corps: 3rd Armored and 8th Mechanized divisions. Headquartered at
Franfurt, this Corps must defend the centrally located Fulda gap and the
large concentration of air assets based at franfurt.
US VIII Corps: 1st Armored and 3rd Mechanized divisions. This Corps defends
the city of Nurenberg and the US nuclear missiles near Ulm.
US Support Units: Six Surface-Air missile units, three Air Wings, two Assault
Helicopter units and two groups of Tactical nuclear missiles (Pershing).
US Reinforcements: 1st Mechanized Division, arrives May 3-4; 2nd Armored
division, May 6-7; 4th Mechanized Division, May 13-14; 2nd Marine Division,
May 15; 101st Airborne Division May 24.

West German I Corps: 3rd and 21st Panzer (Armored) Division; 1st, 7th, and
21st Mechanized Divisions. This Corps defends the northern approaches
(Hannover/Hamburg).
WG II Corps: 10th Panzer, 1st, and 1st Alpine Divisions. This Corps defends
the southern approaches and the city of Munich.
WG III Corps: 5th and 12th Panzer Divisions; 2nd Mechanized Division. This
Corps defends the central approaches.
WG Militia units: Will be called up to defend major cities if war breaks out.
WG Support units: Two air wings, three assault helicopter units, and six
SAM installations.

British I Corps: 1st, 2nd, and 4th Armored Divisions. This powerful armored
force is concentrated near Hannover. The 3rd Mechanized Division (Airmobile)
arrives on May 8th.
Netherland I Corps: 1st and 4th Mechanized Divisions.
Belgian I Corps: 1st and 16th Mechanized Divisions.
These small divisions are ideal for rear area defense against Soviet
Airborne divisions.
These countries also contribute two air wings and four SAM sites.

The French army is not integrated into the NATO command structure but is
expected to supply the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th Mechanized Divisions in the
event of a European war.


Warsaw Pact Order of Battle
===========================

Stationed in Eastern Europe:
2nd Soviet Guards Tank Army, 6 divisions.
3rd Soviet Shock Army, 3 divisions.
20th Soviet Guards Army, 5 divisions.
8th Soviet Guards Army, 4 divisions.
1st Soviet Guards Tank Army, 4 divisions.
East German 3rd Army, 3 divisions.
East German 5th Army, 3 divisions.
Czechoslovakian 1st Army, 3 divisions.
Czechoslovakian 4th Army, 4 divisions.

WP Strategic Reserve:
5th Soviet Guards Tank Army, 12 divisions.
7th Soviet Guards Tank Army, 12 divisions.
8th Soviet Guards Tank Army, 5 divisions.
13th Soviet Mechanized Army, 4 divisions.
16th Soviet Mechanized Army, 12 divisions.
1st Polish Army, 13 divisions.
1st Hungarian Army, 6 divisions.

The strategic situation and Warsaw Pact doctrine require an all-out attack by
WP forces. Soviet strategy envisions overrunning forward NATO defenses and 
airfields before reinforcements arrive and NATO's qualitative air superiority
can be decisive. You may expect concentrated attacks all along the line. The
Soviet strategic reserve may reach the front in as little as two or three 
days. Maximum advantage should be taken of the excellent defensive positions
offered along the major rivers and forests. Air units and SAM support units
should be protected. Without air superiority any prolonged defense or 
counterattack will be impossible. Major cities should be held for political
reasons. The powerful attack strength of the helicopter units should be used
to eliminate WP units which are cut off or to support a counterattack. Nuclear
weapons should be used only as a last resort and must be authorized by the
Commander-in-Chief.


Loading the Game
================

Connect one joystick to the computer using the connector closest to the rear 
of the computer, (Port #2). Turn on the disk drive or cassette drive first 
and then turn on the computer.

Disk: Insert the game diskette into the disk drive and type LOAD "*",8,1 
(Return). When the READY prompt appears, type RUN (Return). The rest of
the program will then be loaded. Leave the game diskette in the disk
drive while the game is playing.

Cassette: Insert the cassette into the tape drive and type LOAD (Return).
When the READY prompt appears, type RUN (Return). The rest of the program
will then be loaded.

After the rest of the program has been loaded the game will automatically
begin a DEMONSTRATION scenario. To exit from the DEMONSTRATION scenario,
press function key F1. Additional data is then loaded and the scenario
selection menu is displayed.


Important - Read Carefully!
===========================

At the end of every day (except in the Demonstration game) a classified NATO
code is displayed and requires the player to enter the correct countercode,
read the letter displayed by the computer when it asks for the countercode.
Then go to the countercode table (found in the beginning of the document!)
and locate the code letter given by the computer. Located directly beneath 
the computer generated code letter is the countercode response. Type the 
countercode into the computer and press the "return" key. If an incorrect 
countercode is entered and the "return" key has not yet been pressed, the 
player should reenter the correct countercode and then press the "return" key.
The last value entered before the "return" key is pressed is taken to be the 
countercode.

Although the player must enter the correct countercode at the end of the first
day, it is permissible on all following days to press the RETURN key without
entering any countercode letter. It should also be noted that if a player does
a restart and begins a new game, he will then again be required to enter the
correct countercode at the end of that game's first day.


Introduction
============

NATO Commander is a complex single-player simulation in which you assume 
command of the NATO armies opposing a massive attack by Warsaw Pact forces.
The simulation takes place in accelerated real-time. With a large number of
activities taking place simultaneously including command entry, movement,
combat, and status message - the game requires your constant attention.


Scenarios
=========

Surprise Attack: In this scenario the Warsaw Pact launches a surprise strike
against the unsuspecting NATO forces. The NATO player must delay the attackers
and inflict maximum casualties. Political Points are ignored in this scenario.
Only the Northern half of the map is used and the NATO forces begin in 
dispersed positions.

Hannover/Hamburg: This scenario uses only the Northern half of the map. Warsaw
Pact forces attempt to overrun the NATO defenders and capture these two key
cities.

Pre-emptive Strike: The NATO player takes the initiative and attacks the 
Warsaw Pact armies. This scenario gives the NATO player an opportunity for
offensive tactics.

The Italian Option: Warsaw Pact forces attack along the German front but offer
peace to the Italians. Political points are doubled as they are required to 
persuade the Italians to join the battle.

You may select from one of four difficulty levels for each scenario.

Your armies may be organized into divisions (larger units) or brigades
(smaller units). Divisions are more powerful and easier to manage, brigades
give you more tactical flexibility.


Commands
========

Commands are entered via the joystick or by depressing the key indicated in
parenthesis ( ). It is not necessary to depress RETURN.

CURSOR CONTROL: The flashing cursor is used to designate which unit you are
communicating with. The joystick may be used to move the cursor. The cursor
may also be moved up/down/right/left in single steps using the standard cursor
control keys. For larger step movements of the cursor, the "." (period), 
(down); "," (comma), (up); "<" (less than), (left); and ">" (greater than),
(right); can be used. The map will scroll when the cursor reaches the edge of
the screen.

UNIT STATUS: (Trigger or Space) This command displays the status of the unit
under the cursor. Included are Unit ID, Strength, Supply Level, Defense Mode,
Morale, and other status information.

MOVE: (M) Commands the unit to move to a new location. After entering the MOVE
command, move the cursor to the new location. Then use the HERE command.

ATTACK: (A) Command the unit to attack an enemy unit. Ground units may only
attack adjacent units. Helicopter units may attack anywhere on the map.
Designate the unit to be attacked using the HERE command.

HERE: (H) Used to designate the destination of a MOVE or ATTACK command. If an
attack is being ordered you will be asked to select an accelerated attack, 
normal attack, or chemical attack using the function keys F1, F3, and F5.

CANCEL: (X) Cancel any outstanding movement or attack orders for the
designated unit.

ORDERS: (O) Used to give special orders to Air or Nuclear units. Air units may
be ordered to begin Air Superiority, Ground Support, or Reconnaissance 
missions. Nuclear units may be commanded to authorize, launch, or cancel
nuclear strikes.

TERRAIN: (T) This command removes the units from the display, allowing you to
see the terrain under those units. Enter T again to restore the display.

FREEZE: (F) Stops the game action while allowing commands to be entered. Enter
F again to resume the action.

GENERAL STATUS: (G) Displays the current situation including casualties, WP
penetration level, Political Points, Combat Points and total Victory Points.

AIR STATUS: (Q) Displays the basic air war status information.

WHO?: (W) Positions the cursor over the source of the previous radio message
unless the message was from a surrendering unit.

SAVE: (S) Saves the current game situation in 2 disk files. Enter a file
name from 1 to 8 characters. The SCN and MAP suffixes are added automatically.

LOAD: (L) Loads a previously saved situation from the disk. Enter the file
name as in SAVE. Once the files are loaded, the game will resume automatically
using the just loaded situation.

RESTART: (F1) Terminates the current game and returns to the scenario 
selection. In all scenarios except the demonstration, additional verification
of a wish to restart must be given by pressing the RETURN key.


Unit Types
==========

American, British, and French units are blue. West German, Dutch, and Belgian
units are green. All Warsaw Pact units are red.

Mechanized Infantry: the backbone of every army. Better on defense than
attacking.

Armor: Fast moving and hard hitting.

Armored Cavalry: Mobile reconnaissance units.

Airborne: used mainly to attack lightly defended rear installations (WP only).

Militia: best suited for fixed defense.

Helicopters: used to eliminate surrounded or weakened units.

Air Wings:

Surface-to-Air Missiles:

Tactical Nuclear Missiles:


Basic Concepts
==============

This simulation is designed to allow the player to concentrate on the tactical
and strategic aspects of the situation without requiring an understanding of
the mechanics underlying the game. For this reason each unit has its own built
in intelligence. For example, units will automatically enter the Tactical mode
and choose their own path from their current location to the location assigned
by the MOVE/HERE command sequence. In doing so they will endeavour to avoid 
enemy units and difficult terrain. As soon as the destination is reached, the
unit will begin to prepare a defensive position. Units which are attacked in
overwhelming strength will attempt to retreat without being ordered to do so.

Modes
=====

A unit may assume one of four modes. In Prepared Defense mode the unit is dug
in a defensive posture. In Tactical mode the unit is in a mobile posture. 
A unit may only move and attack if it is in Tactical mode. The Hasty Defense
and Defense modes are used during the transition from Tactical to Prepared
Defense modes. Units automatically enter the Tactical Mode when ordered
to move or when routed.


Movement
========

Units will move in accordance with the movement commands. Units move more
rapidly over road and clear terrain than river and forested areas. Units
which are fresh will move more readily than broken and routed units. A unit
cannot move through another unit.


Combat
======

A large number of factors affect the results of combat. Tanks are more suited
to attacking, infantry are better on defense. Attacking units must be in 
Tactical mode. Defending units are strongest in Prepared Defense mode. River
and hilly terrain are particularly suited to defense, forests and cities are
also good. Combat is also affected by the amount of air power assigned to
ground support. Most engagements are not resolved with a single round of 
combat: combat continues until one unit is broken or routed and retreats or
is eliminated. Heavy casualties may be sustained by these broken or routed
units. Three varieties of combat are possible. In accelerated combat the
attacker accepts additional casualties in order to put maximum pressure on
the defender. A chemical attack reduces the effectiveness of the infantry
components involved while leaving the tanks at full strength. There is a 
political point penalty for the use of chemical weapons by NATO forces.


Morale
======

Morale levels are Fresh, Pressured, Tired, Broken, and Routed. Both combat and
movement are hindered by low morale levels. Units will gradually recover their
morale if left undisturbed.


Air Operations
==============

Air Wings may be assigned one of three missions. Air Superiority orders the 
wing to engage and defeat the WP air units directly. This is the most 
effective method of reducing the strength of the WP air forces. Air Wings on
Ground Support missions assist ground units in both defensive and offensive
combat. Air Wings on Reconnaissance missions may discover location of WP
units which are not in combat with NATO forces. (The location of these units
is not normally known to the NATO commanders except at the very beginning of
the game.) Surface-to-Air missile (SAM) units contribute to the attrition of
the WP air forces. The usual NATO strategy is to weaken the WP air forces
early in the game by assigning Air Superiority missions. Once the WP forces
are weakened, Ground Support missions are the assigned to turn the tide of
ground battle.


Nuclear Operations
==================

Nuclear strikes must be authorized by the Commander-in-Chief. Such
authorization will not be given unless the battlefield situation is serious
or nuclear weapons have already been used by WP forces. There is also a
political point penalty for using nuclear weapons. Only one nuclear strike
request may be outstanding at a time. Generally a number of hours will
transpire between targeting a strike and its execution.


Victory Points
==============

Victory Points are a measure of how successfully (or unsuccessfully) you are
conducting the campaign. Victory points may be Political or Combat Points.
Political points represent general world opinion as to the progress of the
battle and are gained by capturing cities, political points are lost by losing
cities and using nuclear or chemical weapons. Combat points reflect the battle
situation and are gained by inflicting casualties on the enemy, combat points
are lost by allowing the enemy to penetrate into your territory. At various
points in the game certain political events take place. These may be 
beneficial to the NATO countries (A strike in Poland) or detrimental (The
surrender of Finland). The accumulation of these events will eventually cause
either the NATO or WP alliances to crumble, ending the game.


Tactical Tips
=============

The simulation requires a sound overall defensive strategy, although offensive
opportunities will develop as the NATO air forces provide ground support and
the WP attack loses its momentum.

Position your defensive units to take advantage of the terrain, river lines
and mountains are the best. Defending units should be positioned to support
each other, don't allow many WP units to gang up on a single NATO unit. Make
sure your units have time to take up prepared defense positions. Avoid
encountering WP units while moving in tactical mode.

Use massed helicopter attacks to eliminate WP units which threaten rival rear
area installations, air wings, nuclear weapons, etc.

Don't ignore the Air Forces, they can turn the tide of the battle. Wear the
enemy down with air superiority missions and then use ground support.

Note that helicopters, SAM missiles, Air Wings, and Nuclear missiles cannot
move: they must be protected.

Don't be reluctant to FREEZE the action to study the situation and plan your
strategy.

Move your reserve and replacement units into the battle as soon as possible.
Try to maintain a backup defensive line behind your main defenses.

Use your imagination. The possibilities are endless. Use the SAVE and LOAD
functions to try different strategic variations.
