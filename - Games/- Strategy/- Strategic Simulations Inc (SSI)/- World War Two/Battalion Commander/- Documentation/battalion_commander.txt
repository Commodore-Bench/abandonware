INTRODUCTION
Battalion Commander puts you in command of a modern fighting force the size of
an army battalion. The game lets you experience small unit combat on the
modern battlefield. As the battalion commander, your role in the game is to
issue orders to company and platoon commanders. Subordinate commanders issue
orders to their subordinates so that companies or plattons will work together
to overcome the enemy forces. How well you can coordinate your forces will
determine the outcome of the battle.

GAME_OPTIONS
After the game loads the computer will ask you to set up the game options.

Select_a_Game

1.Novice: destroy a Soviet tank battalion which is out of sight of your units
to the north. The Soviet tank battalion consists of two companies. similar in
structure to yours. Receive points for destroying enemy units.

2.Pursuit_and_Exploitation: This refers to the actions taken by an attacker to
penetrate an enemy's weakened defense system and then to claim victory.
Receive points for destroying enemy units and for capturing special units,
including artillery batteries, supply depots, and Headquarters units.

3._Meeting_Engagement: This is a sort of military chess, with victory going to
the side that displays greater skill. Each side is equally weighted in
relative strength. However, one side may be better in combat than the other
side but have fewer forces. Receive points for destroying the opponents
forces.

4._Attack: In this game, your objective is to break through the enemy defenses
to occupy a key terrain feature marked with a blue "X". Although you have
twice the strength, the enemy is quick and cunning.

5.Defense: This basically the same as the attack game. however, you're the one
who must defend the objective position, marked by a blue "X", from attack by
the enemy.

Nationality: You may select ground forces from either the United States, the
Soviet Union, or China for either your side or the enemy's side. The strength
of a U.S. battalion will be reduced by about 20% when opposing a Soviet
battalion and 50% when opposing a Chinese battalion. A Soviet battalion is
reduced about 30% when opposing a Chinese battalion. The purpose of these
reductions is to provide play balance between forces of differing intrinsic
strengths.

Terrain Maps: Forty terrain maps are available. When the computer asks for the
number of a terrain map, type the two digit number from 01 to 40,
corresponding to the terrain map you want for the game. A list of the terrain
maps and symbols is at the back of this manual.

Relative Strengths: The game may be made more difficult or less difficult by
changing the relative strength of the two sides. Press the following keys to
adjust the relative strengths;

  1 - reduces your strength by 50%
  2 - reduces your strength by 20%
  3 - reduces neither side
  4 - reduces enemy's strength by 20%
  5 - reduces enemy's strength by 50%

Chain of_ Command
The Battalion Commander normally issues orders to company commanders.
Company Commanders in turn issue orders to Platoon Commanders, and so on,
until everyone has orders consisetent with the intentions of the Battalion
Commander.

 The Battalion Commander issues orders directly to Battalion Headquarters, platoons in the Combat Support Company, and platoons of companies temporarily under his direct command. The battalion Commander may
take command of one company at a time. When he does this he still remains in command of the battalion.

Units under your Command
1. Companies - You may command up to four companies, depending on the game
selected and nationality of each side. Companies are designated by letters
 A, B, C, D. To tell the computer which companieyou want to give an order to,
press the letter key corresponding to that company.

2. Platoons_- If you are in direct command of a company, you may issue orders
directly to its platoons. Platoons are numbered 1 to 6. Press the number key
of the platoon you want to give an order to.

3. Combat Support Company - In addition to the combat forces under your
command, you also command a battalion headquarters and some platoons of the
Combat Support Company:

   Supply Train - This unit delivers ammunition, fuel, and other supplies to
    your units. The operation of this unit, unlike the others, is automatic.    
    To find out which company is being supplied, position the cursor over the       
    Supply Train. If you would like to change the company receiving supplies
    from the Supply Train, simply press the corresponding key for the unit
    you would like supply, and press P for "Priority unit for resupply."
    If a Supply Train is destroyed, it will be replaced.

    Battalion Headquarters - This is where you are located. It is an 
    important unit, so big points are awarded for its destruction. If a 
    Battalion Headquarters is destroyed it will be replaced.

    Scout Platoon - This consists of infantry mounted in infantry carriers
    (U.S.) or trucks (China). The infantry may be dismounted from the 
    vehicles and can operate independently of the carriers. Select the 
    Scout Platoon by pressing the S key. If the infantry may be dismounted, 
    you can do so by pressing the I key.

    Heavy Mortar platoon - United States and Soviet Battalions both have a
    Heavy Mortar Platoon assigned to their Combat Support Companies.

    Antitank Platoon - A United States Infantry Battalion will have an
    Antitank Platoon assigned. Tank battalions do not include this platoon.
    an Antitank Platoon includes vehicles that mount highly sophisticated
    and deadly antitank guided missles.

   Engineer Platoon - This platoon is used for fighting and for bridge  
   construction. To remove a bridge, position cursor above or below the 
   bridge on the screen. Then tell the Engineer Platoon to remove the bridge  
   by pressing R. The Engineer Platoon will go to the position you designate
   and, after a few minutes the bridge will disappear. In the game, only
   straight, horizontal stretches of river are suitable for constructing   
   bridges. If you send the Engineer to the wrong area, you will receive a   
   warning message. Place the cursor above or below the area where you would  
   like the bridge and press B. Bridge construction takes a couple of minutes   
   to complete. Remember, do not place the cursor over the bridge or bridge   
   site when removing or constructing a bridge.

4 Fire Support Officer - This menber of your Battalion Headquarters staff is 
responsible for coordinating artillery support for your battalion. No heavy
artillery is assigned to a battalion. Artillery is assigned to higher headquarters, including brigade and division level. To obtain fire support, you must give an order to the Fire Support Officer, who passes on the request to higher headquarters. Up to two fire requests may be acted on at a time and
two targets engaged. A fire support mission will terminate after 5 minutes
unless you renew it by issuing the order again.

The following keys are used to select the units to which you will be sending
orders:

      A    Company A
      B    Company B
      C    Company C
      D    Company D
      1 - 6 Platoons within a company
      E   Engineer Platoon 
      H   Battalion Headquarters
      S   Scout Platoon (Carriers)
      I   Scout Platoon (Infantry)
      M   Heavy Mortar Platoon
      T   Antitank platoon
      F   Fire Support Officer

If you press the wrong key, or do not wish to give an orders to the unit
corresponding to the key pressed, hit the DELETE key.

Unit Status
To find out more about a unit, position the cursor over the unit. Information
on the unit contains the number of personnel(PERS) and the number of
vehicles(VEH). The supply condition and troop condition are also displayed.

 1. Unit Title- If the unit is a mechanized infantry(US) or motorized Rifle  
 (Soviet) platoon, it may contain infantry that can be dismounted and 
 controlled as a separate platoon. If so , there will be a "+" after the unit 
 title. After the title of the Supply Train, the computer will indicate which 
 company it is in the process of resupplying.

 2. Unit Strength- The report will show the number of personnel and vehicles.

 3. Supply Condition- The amount of fuel and amount of each type of ammunition
 are represented as numbers from 0 to 9.

 4. Troop Condition- In the lower left-hand corner of the report you will see  
 a one-word description of the condition of the troops. The condition is a 
 composite rating of fatigue and morale.

 Unit Direction- A unit can face in one of 8 different directions. If the platoon is moving, it will face in the direction of movement. If stationary, the unit will face in the direction of its target. Certain units will have a lower chance of seeing an enemy unit approaching from the flanks or rear. To change a unit direction, the unit must be stationary. You can then either issue an order for indirect fire, which will force the unit to face the direction of the enemy; or issue an order for as normal fire target, which will force the unit to face in the direction of the cursor position.

Issuing Orders
Orders are passed on to your subordinates via the message Center every 15 seconds. When the Message Center is in the process of sending a message, an "M" appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the text area of the screen. Because all orders go through the Message Center , there is a slight delay between the time an order is issued and the time it is carried out, the computer will not recognize the key press corresponding to the order. To issue an order, you must press the key of the unit that is to receive the order; then press the key that corresponds to the order you are giving. The orders are:

  Key       Description of Order                    Available to              
  G         Go to position marked by the cursor       All units except FSO
  N         Provide normal fire                       All units except FSO
  H         Hold your fire                            All units
  F         Request supressive fire                   All units
  S         Provide smoke screen at cursor position   All units
  T         Priority target                           All units except FSO
  B         Build bridge at cursor location           Engineer Platoon
  R         Remove bridge at cursor location          Engineer platoon
  D         Dig in your troops                        All units except FSO
  A         Assuming command of your company          Company Commander
  C         Returning command of your company         Company Commander
  P         Priority unit for resupply                All units except FSO
  +         Mount your infantry                       Carrier Platoon
  -         Dismount your infantry                    Carrier Platoon

STRATEGY___________________________________________________________________________

The objective of Battalion Commander is to make the decisions that will enable your forces to work together in an effort to destroy the enemy units. In order to do this, you must fully understand the structure of your forces and their capabilities.

Organization of Forces
Army forces are organized into units. The basic unit of Battalion Commander is
the platoon. A platton will usually contain 20 to 40 soldiers.  A platoon is
commanded by a lieutenant. A company, which contains a group of platoons, is
commanded by a captain. And a battalion which is made up of 3 or 4 companies,
is commanded by a lieutenant colonel. Each unit has a particular function:

  Rifle Platoon is the basic fighting force.
  Tank Platoon acts as a fast striking force.
  Antitank Platoon protects other units from tanks.
  Supply Train provides fuel and ammunition to other units.
  Scout Platoon obtains information on enemy forces and acts as a screen between the 
  enemy and the main body of forces.
  Engineer Platoon constructs fieldworks to facilitate or restrict the movement of 
  forces.
  Machine Gun Platoon provides extra firepower to key areas of the battlefield.
  Motorized Rifle Platoon is the same as the rifle Platoon except that it is more 
  mobile since it is transported by infantry carriers.
  Mortar Platoon provides indirect fire at long ranges.
  Headquarters Platoon directs the actions of the other units.

Combat Power
The main components of modern ground combat are infantry and armor. Each has
certain capabilities and limitations:

Infantry

Capabilities:
 - Protect tanks and antitank guided missiles (ATGM) from dismounted infantry and 
   antitank (AT) gunners.
 - Able to move mounted troops as rapidly as tanks.
 - Can negotiate water barriers with relative ease.
 - effective use of machine guns and small arms.
 - Kill tanks and other armored vehicles with medium AT guns out to 1000 meters (10 
   characters on the screen) and light AT guns out to 200 meters.
 - Dismount to: 
   * Clear enemy infantry out of close terrain.
   * Dig in and hold ground against infantry assaults.
   * provide security_outposts and patrols.
   * lay mines.

Limitations:
 - Armored personnel carriers (APC) have thin armor and are easier to disable than 
   tanks. A portion of mounted infantry become casualties when the APC they are 
   riding in is destroyed.
 - When dismounted, infantry is vulnerable to tanks, small arms, and artillery and 
   mortar fire.

Tanks (& Assault Guns)

Capabilities:
 - Major advantages are mobility, armor protection, and firepower.
 - One of the few units which have the ability to kill tanks and enemy troops out to 
   a range of about 2500 meters.
 - Invulnerable to artillery and small arms enables these units to penetrate enemy 
   forces.

Limitations:
 - Units are vulnerable to ATGM, AT guns, tanks, and mines.
 - Difficulty in identifying infantry and AT gunners is close terrain (woods & 
   cities) slows progress in tight terrain.

 - Units are unable to cross water barriers, except over bridges. This applies to 
   American M60A1 and Chinese Type 59 tanks only. Amphibious Soviet T-62 tanks are 
   able to swim across rivers as are the American and Soviet APC's in the game.

Weapons
Each platoon possesses a certain number of rifles and may also have one or two
heavy weapons. The weapons available are:

Rifles - These have a maximum range of about 1000 meters, and a maximum
effective range of 200-300 meters.

Light Machine Guns - These weapons have an effective range of about 1000
meters and a high rate of fire.

Heavy Machine Guns - These are part of the armament of APC's and tanks with an
effective range about 1500 meters. These can disable thin-skinned armored
vehicles such as APC's.

Light Antitank Weapons - These include rifle-proppelled grenades and
bazooka-type weapons. They have an effective range of about 200-300 meters,
but are not particularly effective against tank armor.

Medium Antitank Weapons - The American units are equipped with antitank guided
Missiles (ATGM) which are more effective the Soviet or Chinese recoiless AT
guns since they can be guided towards the target after it is fired.

Heavy Antitank Weapons - Only the US and Soviet units have long range weapons.
This weapon has a range of 3000 meters, but an effective range of about 500
meters; The US version of this weapon is slightly faster than the soviet.

Mortars - Heavy mortars can cover large areas, but with a slower rate of fire.
Light mortars cover smaller areas, but can be fired more rapidly. US and
chinese units have both heavy and light mortars; Soviet units have only heavy
mortars.

Howitzers - These are a type of heavy artillery used by ground support forces.
they are long-range (10,000 meters) weapons which provide indirect fire, like
mortars.

Tank Guns - Tank guns fire high explosive, armor piercing ammunition,
effective at ranges under 2500 meters.

Grenades - All infantry carrt both hand grenades and rifle-propelled grenades.
the range varies from 500 & 600 meters for Chinese and US units to 800 meters
for Soviet units.

Mines - Combinations of antipersonnel and antiarmor mines may be laid by
either infantry of engineer units. These result in few casualties, but can
slow down the enemy units and force them into open areas.
 
Vehicles
There are four types of vehicles in Battalion Commander. Only one type of
vehicle in each unit. 

Trucks - Trucks lack the protection of armor. for that reason they can be
destroyed by small arms fire. Trucks do not move very well off the road and
must cross water at bridges.

APC's - The US and Soviet armies are the only ones that have armored personnel
carriers as a part of the battalion organization. the chinese have a shortage
of carriers, and the infantry carriers are assigned to the regimental
headquarters, which can assign them to battalions as circumstances dictate.
The soviet version is more heavily armed than its American counterpart, but
both have thin armor and are vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire.

Assault Guns - Only the Chinese have assault guns in this game. The main
difference between assault guns and tanks is that the tanks have aturret which
can revolve to face in any direction. Assault guns are vulnerable to rear and
flank attacks.

Tanks - The Soviet tank is the only amphibious one in the game. The Chinese
tank is substantially inferior to both the Soviet and US tanks in terms of
firepower and armor.

Basic Tactical Doctrine
The following are some of the concepts on combat doctrine generally held by
all modern military powers.

Offense and Defense
The primary theory of war is that decisive results are achieved only through
offensive action. The best defense cannot bring victory - it can only postpone
defeat. Defense is considered a necessary form of combat used only to gain
time to develope the capability to commence offensive action. When
circumstances and enemy actions force a commander to assume a defensive
posture, he must assume the initative and resume offensive actions at the
earliest possible time.

Surprise Attack
To maintain the initiative, commanders must seize every opportunity to strike
the enemy when and where he is not prepared for battle. Surprise is sought at
all times to paralyze the enemy's will to resist and deprive him of the
ability to react effectively.

Suppression and Obscuration
Suppression refers to directing heavy fire against an enemy force for the
purpose of temporarily removing the unit's ability to fire at friendly forces.
Heavy machinegun fire will not completely destroy an enemy unit, but will
reduce it's effectiveness. Obscuration refers to the use of cover and
concealment to allow units to maneuver on the battlefield without being
subjected to enemy fire. Where no natural cover exists, smoke may be used to
hide the maneuvering force.

Offensive Maneuvers
Although the objectives of offensive maneuvers may vary, there are two basic
maneuvers used by modern ground forces: envelopement and penetration.

1) Envelopement is a maneuver primarily directed against one or both flanks of
an enemy force in conjunction with assistance from units attacking frontally.

2) Penetration is normally employed only when the enemy does not have an
assailable flank. This is not as desireable as an envelopement maneuver since
it uses a frontal assault, which can result in high casualties. Penetration
can also be used after an envelopement has been initiated.
