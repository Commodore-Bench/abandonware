1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
    BOMB ALLEY is an operational level game featuring combat between British
and Axis air, land, surface-naval and submarine forces for control of the
Mediterranean and North Africa in 1942.  Every ship, airplane or infantry
company available to the local British and Axis commanders in the summer of
1942 are now under your control.  You will need to organize your ships into
task forces to perform various missions: sea lane, interdiction, land
bombardment, supply/troop transport, evacuation, etc.  All play revolves around
the creation and manipulation of these task forces and the effective
concentration of air power.  Included are a campaign game covering June 11 to
August 31, 1942, and minigames covering the invasion of Crete in May 1941 and
Operation Pedestal in August 1942.

1.1 Description of Action:
-------------------------
    Each game turn represents the passage of 12 hours.  A game turn consists
of:(1) building and adjusting friendly task forces;(2) moving your task
forces;(3) launching air missions during daylight turns;(4) combat resolution.

1.2 Talking to the Computer:
---------------------------
    To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers (such as ship
or task force identification numbers or the number of aircraft performing a
mission), type the number into the computer and press the <return> key.  To
select a routine from the Task Force Menu or answer a Yes/No question, just
press the desired key.  If you wish to halt the game during the combat
resolution phase, type <CNTRL-C>.  This will cause the program to pause until
you press another key.

1.3 Saving a Game:
-----------------
    Upon completion of the combat phase of each turn, the computer will allow
the player(s) to save the game in progress.  You will need a scratch disk to
store the saved game data.  The disk must be initialized for SSI use by
following the instructions included in the game program.  Once the game is
saved, you will be able to restart it from the point at which you left off.

1.4 The Map:
-----------
    The map is a 40 x 40 square grid representation of the Mediterranean
Theatre.  Each square measures 60 miles in width.  Land Squares are yellow,
orange, or green; black squares are ocean; while squares are bases; red squares
are British TFs; and blue squares are Axis TFs.  The range between squares is
calculated between the center of the first square and the center of the second
square.  The number thus obtained is rounded up.

Example: 5 squares over and 1 square up equals range of 5.099 or 6.

3.2 Historical Set-Up:
---------------------
    At the start of each game, the computer will assign all ships, aircraft,
infantry and supplies to their historical locations prior to the battle.

3.3 Daytime (AM) Sequence:
-------------------------
A. Axis TF Adjustment Phase
B. Axis Movement Phase
C. British TF Adjustment Phase
D. British Movement Phase
E. British Air Operations Phase
F. Axis Air Operations Phase
G. Combat Resolution Phase
H. Save Game Phase

3.4 Nighttime (PM) Sequence:
---------------------------
    The PM sequence is the same as the AM sequence except steps E and F are
deleted.

3.5 Keep Time:
-------------
    An AM turn followed by a PM turn equals one day.  The calendar is adjusted
at the end of the PM turn.


4.0 TASK FORCE ADJUSTMENT PHASE
===============================
    At the start of the task force adjustment phase, the computer will display
a menu listing four options for adjusting your forces and seven options for
reviewing the status of your forces.  To enter the desired routine, just press
the corresponding numbered or lettered key.

4.1 Forming Task Forces:
-----------------------
A. Enter the code for the port in which you will assemble your TF (I,G,A).
B. Enter the code for the mission your TF will perform.  See Section 9.2 for
   a list of the possible missions.
C. The computer will list those ships in the selected port that are eligible
   to perform the selected mission.  Each ship will be displayed with its I.D.
   number.
D. Assemble your TF by entering the desired ship numbers.  In some cases, the
   screen cannot list all of the eligible ships at once; if you do not see the
   ships that you want, press <RETURN> and another batch of ships can be
   listed.
E. When the computer prompts "CONTINUE SELECTION Y/N", press (N) if you are
   satisfied with your selection, or press (Y), and the computer will run
   through the list again.

4.2 Combining TFs:
-----------------
    Two TFs occupying the same grid location may be combined in the following
manner:
A. Enter the number of the "gaining TF" and the "merging TF"
B. All ships in the "merging TF" will be added to the "gaining TF" and the
   "merging TF" will be deleted.
C. If the "merging TF" had a lower endurance than the "gaining TF", then the
   "gaining TF" will assume the lower endurance.
D. Submarine TFs may not combine with non-submarine TFs.

4.3 Dividing TFs:
----------------
A. Enter the number of the TF you wish to divide.  The computer will list the
   ships in the selected TF.  A ship with "***" printed after its name is
   crippled.
B. the Axis player is allowed 9 active TFs, the British player is allowed 11.
   If you are currently using the maximum number of TFs, then the computer will
   display the message "TOO MANY ACTIVE TFs" and return to the menu.
C. Enter the number of the ships you wish to transfer to a new TF.  The
   computer will set up a new TF for you.  The new TF will have the same
   mission and endurance as the original TF.
D. If you are currently using fewer than your maximum number of TFs, then the
   DIVIDE TF function may be used to "scuttle" crippled ships.  Just enter the
   letter "S" following the number of the ship you are transferring.  Your
   opponent will receive one less victory point for ships that are scuttled
   than would ordinarily be awarded for a ship sunk involuntarily. (Your crew
   is assumed to have been removed safely)

4.4 Loading Transports:
----------------------
    Troops and supplies may be loaded onto ships which are located in a
friendly port (Italy, Gibraltar, Alexandria).
A. Use the LOAD TRANSPORTS - TRAIN CV PILOTS routine, enter the code for the
   port in which the loading is to take place.  The computer will list all
   eligible ships in that port with a cargo capacity greater than zero.
B. Enter the number of the ship you wish to load and then enter the number of
   infantry companies and/or supply units you wish to load.  Each infantry
   company represents 100 men.
C. If you wish to unload cargo while still in port, type a "U" in response to
   the question "number of infantry companies/supply units to be loaded?".
   By typing a "U" the current cargo will be unloaded.
D. Only supply units may be loaded into tanker (TK) type ships.

4.5 Training Carrier Pilots:
---------------------------
    To replace losses for depleted carrier air groups, land based aircraft
(pilots) must be trained for carrier operations.
A. Use the LOAD TRANSPORTS - TRAIN CV PILOTS routine.  Select the code for the
   port that is furnishing the aircraft for training.  The carrier must already
   be assigned to this port.
B. Enter the number of the carrier that is to receive the aircraft.
C. The computer will list all of the eligible aircraft available in the port.
   Enter the quantity you wish to transfer.
D. The carrier will be taken out of circulation for two days while the
   "training" is being accomplished.

4.6 Checking the Pipeline:
-------------------------
    Reinforcements and repaired ships will periodically be sent to ports you
control.  To check the status of these ships, you may wish to request the
current condition of your ship "pipeline".
A. Enter the code (I,G,A) for the port you wish to check.
B. The computer will list all ships currently in that port and all ships due
   to arrive there.
C. For ships in the repair, refit or reinforcement "pipeline", the computer
   will list the time in days before that ship can return or arrive.

4.7 Sunk Ships Display:
----------------------
    The computer will list all ships that have been sunk and the points awarded
for their sinking.

4.8 Air Group Display:
---------------------
    The computer will display the number of each type of aircraft assigned to
each friendly airbase or carrier that is active.

4.9 List Active TFs:
-------------------
A. The computer lists the TF number, mission, and endurance for each friendly
   TF currently active.
B. The computer will prompt "ENTER TF NUMBERS." If you wish to examine the
   ships in a particular TF, enter the TF number and <return>.  If you do not
   wish to examine a TF just press <return>.

4.10 Map Display:
----------------
    The computer will display the map and all friendly active TFs.  If you
wish to locate a particular friendly TF on the map, enter that TF's number.
The TFs square will flash to indicate its location.

4.11 Malta Status Display:
-------------------------
    The computer will display the number of troops and supply dumps you control
on Malta.

4.12 Base Display:
-----------------
A. The computer will display the infantry companies, supply dumps, fighters,
   and bombers available at each friendly base.
B. The computer will prompt "REINFORCE AFRICA CORP Y/N" or "REINFORCE EIGHTH
   ARMY Y/N".
C. If you press (Y), the computer will ask which African base you wish to use
   as a reinforcement source.  Enter the desired base code.
D. The computer will ask you how many infantry companies, supply dumps, and
   aircraft of each type you wish to transfer.  To transfer from the base to
   the front lines, enter a positive number.  To transfer from the front back
   to the base, enter a negative number.  If you do not wish to transfer a
   particular item, just press (RETURN).
E. When listing aircraft transfers, the computer will display two numbers,
   separated by a colon.  The first number is the quantity of the aircraft type
   at the source base.  The second number is the quantity of the aircraft type
   at the front.
F. When transferring supplies from a base to the front, part of the quantity
   transferred will be "consumed" in transit.  The percentage consumed will be
   equal to the distance from the base to the front divided by 100.

4.13 Ending the Game:
--------------------
    Both players should agree before ending the game.  The computer will
display the final score.


5.0 TASK FORCE MOVEMENT
=======================
    TFs move by expending movement points.  The number of movement points a TF
is allowed is dependent on the TFs "fleet speed".

5.1 Fleet Speed:
---------------
A. A TFs fleet speed is calculated as 25 knots or the speed of the slowest ship
   in the TF, whichever is lower.
B. the speed of a TF assigned a "T", "E" or "ES" mission (see 9.2) will be 30
   knots or the speed of the slowest ship in the TF, whichever is lower.

5.2 Movement:
------------
A. A TF receives one movement point for each 2-1/2 knots of fleet speed, A TF
   will receive a minimum of three movement points.
B. A TF expends two movement points for each square moved in directions N, S,
   E, W.
C. A TF expends three movement points for each square moved in directions NW,
   NE, SW, SE.
D. A TF with fewer than two points remaining in its move, may not move any
   further, but it may still "dock".
E. If you accidentally press the wrong key while moving, you may press the
   (A)bort key and start your move over.  This may not be done after you have
   docked a TF.
F. A TF may never enter a land square.  A TF may move freely through any other
   square.

5.3 Entering Harbor - Unloading Ships:
-------------------------------------
A. A TF that begins its move on a friendly base square may enter the harbor and
   unload cargo by pressing (9) for "dock".  If a TF begins its turn in harbor
   and wishes to remain there, the player must press (9).  If a TF begins its
   turn in harbor and wishes to exit the harbor while remaining on the base
   square, the player should press (0).
B. Each ship may unload a maximum of six infantry companies or three supply
   units or an equivalent combination of infantry and supply.  Tankers may
   unload maximum of 6 supply points per turn.
C. While "in harbor" a TF may never be attacked by enemy ships or submarines.
D. While "in harbor" a TFs ships are more vulnerable to air attack, bomber
   accuracy is doubled when attacking ships "in harbor".
E. Axis ships may unload on Malta (amphibious assault).  Follow the
   procedure in A above.  Ships will unload infantry/supplies at a rate of
   4/2 instead of 6/3.  Tankers will unload 2 supplies per turn.  When
   assaulting Malta, Axis ships will never enter the harbor.
F. Once Axis forces have captured Malta no British troops or supplies may
   be unloaded on Malta.

5.4 Movement Sequence:
---------------------
A. During the movement phase, TFs must be moved sequentially according to
   TF number.  Once a TF has completed its move, the action cannot be reversed.
B. A player may examine the ships in a TF at any time during the TFs movement
   segment.  Press the (S) ships key and the computer will give a complete
   status display for each ship in the TF.  The column heads for the display
   are explained in section 2.3.


6.0 PLANNING LAND ATTACKS
=========================
    During the AM turns, the computer will display the number of troops and
supplies available on your African Front, and will ask the question "DO YOU
WISH TO ATTACK Y/N".
A. Enter the level of your attack (0-5); zero means no attack.
B. A level 1 attack is a reconnaissance in force and consumes one supply dump.
   A level 5 attack is an all-out Blitz and will consume five supply dumps,
   etc.
C. If you wish to avoid combat, enter (R) to retreat, the front will shift
   one square (60 miles) away from the enemy.  Combat may still occur if the
   British retreat and the Axis employs a level 5 attack.


7.0 AIR OPERATIONS
==================
    During the Air Operations Phase, a player may (1) launch CAP and search
aircraft, (2) observe search results, (3) launch air strikes, (4) transfer
aircraft.

7.1 CAP and Search Missions:
---------------------------
A. At the start of each Air Operations Phase, each player must determine how
   many of his fighters will fly CAP missions and how many of his bombers will
   fly search missions.  Aircraft performing CAP or search may not participate
   in air strikes or transfers during that turn.
B. Fighters may fly two types of CAP missions: (1) normal CAP, and (2) long-
   range CAP.  Normal CAP will protect only the TF or airbase from which it
   originated. Long-range CAP will protect any friendly TF within a five square
   range of the launching base or carrier.  CAP will never protect a friendly
   submarine task force.  Only a fraction of an air group performing long-
   range CAP will intercept an enemy air strike (the greater the distance
   between the CAP's home base and the airstrike target, the smaller the
   fraction).  The percentage of planes intercepting is as follows:

        Range to Target                 % of CAP Intercepting
               0                                 76
               1                                 43
               2                                 30
               3                                 23
               4                                 18
               5                                 15

C. Bombers may fly two types of search missions: (1) normal search, (2)
   submarine search.  Normal search missions can detect only enemy surface TFs.
   Submarine search missions can detect only enemy submarines.
D. Each active airbase is equipped with ten float planes which automatically
   fly normal search missions every AM turn.  These planes fly independently
   (not in conjunction with searching bombers from the same airbase).  These
   float planes may never be destroyed.
E. Search ranges for aircraft are listed below:

   SWORDFISH    12      SM79    20      JU88    20
   BEAUFORT     20      DO17    20      JU87    10
   FLOAT PLANE  20

   Range is calculated as shown in section 1.4.
F. The maximum search range of a base or TF is equal to the search range of
   the lowest-range search plane.

7.2 Launching Air Strikes:
-------------------------
    Enemy bases and enemy TFs sighted on the search results display may be
attacked by available friendly aircraft within range.
A. The computer will request a target for each friendly active airbase/carrier.
   Type in the ID number of the enemy TF/base you wish to attack.  The computer
   will list the range to the target and ask you how many of each type of
   aircraft you want to launch.  The computer will not allow you to attack
   unsighted enemy TFs.  A player may launch a maximum of 20 airstrikes per
   AM turn.  Within this restriction there is no limit to the number of strikes
   that may be launched from a friendly carrier or airbase, or the number of
   strikes that may be launched against a single enemy TF or base.  The first
   airstrike launched from a base will consume 1 supply dump; subsequent
   strikes launched from that base will not consume supplies.  The maximum
   range of an anti-ship airstrike is eight spaces.
B. The following bases may be attached by typing in the target numbers listed
   below:

   GIBRALTAR    1       ITALY     16      TRIPOLI      20
   ALEXANDRIA   2       SICILY    17      BENGHAZI     21
   MALTA        3       SARDINIA  18      ATHENS       16
   TOBRUK       4       CRETE     19      MOLAOI       17

C. The attack ranges for aircraft are listed below:

   SPITFIRE     5       SM79      10      DO17         10
   FULMAR       6       JU88      12      JU52         12
   ME109        5       JU87       5
   SWORDFISH    6       BEAUFORT  12

D. Spitfire, Fulmar, and ME109 aircraft may be included in airstrikes, but
   they may never attack enemy surface or submarine targets.  They function
   as escorts to protect the bombers and shoot down enemy CAP.

7.3 Aircraft Transfers:
----------------------
    Aircraft may be transferred between airbases and/or carriers with the
following restrictions:
A. Only two air transfer missions may be performed each AM turn.
B. Aircraft may never transfer from an airbase to a carrier. (This requires
   pilot training, see paragraph 4.5).
C. For transfer purposes, aircraft have their range tripled.

7.4 Air Transport Operations:
----------------------------
    The Axis player may transport troops or supplies between friendly airbases
by using the JU52 transport aircraft.
A. Whenever the JU52 aircraft is included in an air transfer mission (see 7.4),
   the computer will ask "TRANSPORT TROOPS OR SUPPLIES T/S".  Press (T) to
   transport infantry, press (S) to transport supplies; press (RETURN) if you
   do not wish to transport any cargo.
B. If the transfer range is less than five, then each JU52 may transport one
   infantry or 1/6 of a supply unit.  If the transfer range is greater than or
   equal to five, then each JU52 may transport 1/10 of an infantry company or
   1/60 of a supply unit.

7.5 Airborne Assault:
--------------------
A. An Axis airborne assault will occur the first time during the game in which
   Sicily-based JU52s are included in an airstrike against Malta.  Each JU52
   included in the strike will attempt to transfer one infantry company from
   Sicily to Malta.  If a JU52 is destroyed by a CAP or AA fire, an infantry
   company is also destroyed.
B. An airborne assault may only occur once during the game, after which JU52s
   may not be included in airstrikes.

7.6 Fighter Effectiveness:
-------------------------
    The law of diminishing returns applies to both air combat over North Africa
and CAP interceptors.  That is, the effectiveness of each additional fighter
will decrease as the total fighters used increases.


8.0 COMBAT RESOLUTION
=====================
    During the combat resolution phase, the computer will automatically perform
the following functions:
(1) Air Combat over Africa
(2) Air Strike Resolution
(3) Surface and Submarine Combat Resolution
(4) Return aircraft to their bases/carriers
(5) Resolve land combat
(6) Repair & Refit of ships
(7) Activate reinforcements

8.1 Air Combat over Africa:
--------------------------
    Each AM turn, the Eighth Army based aircraft will exchange blows with the
Afrika Corps-based aircraft.  This occurs using the following sequence:
A. Each Afrika Corps ME109 will engage an Eighth Army fighter/bomber.  The
   type of aircraft engaged is determined randomly.
B. Each Eighth Army Spitfire will engage an Afrika Corps fighter or bomber.
   The type of aircraft engaged is determined randomly.
C. Afrika Corps and Eighth Army bombers that survive air combat over Africa
   will perform ground support missions during the subsequent land combat
   phase.
D. In Air Combat over Africa the ME109 will enjoy a slight tactical advantage
   over the Spitfire (will shoot down enemy aircraft better).

8.1.1 Air Combat Over Malta:
---------------------------
    Air combat over Malta occurs each AM turn in which Axis troops have a
foothold on Malta.
A. Air combat will follow the sequence listed below:
     (1) Sicily-based long-range CAP will attack Malta-based bombers and
         fighters available for ground support missions.
     (2) Malta-based long-range CAP will attack Sicily-based bombers and
         fighters available for ground support missions.

8.2 Air Strike Resolution:
-------------------------
    Each air strike is resolved in three segments:
(1) CAP resolution, (2) Flak resolution, (3) Bomb or torpedo hit resolution.
A. Before an air strike group can attack an enemy TF or base if must first
   survive the onslaught of each CAP fighter group protecting the target
   individual CAP fighters will randomly select a bomber or escort fighter
   target and attack it.  If the attack fails to shoot down the target
   aircraft, then the target aircraft will counterattack.  This sequence is
   repeated for each participating CAP fighter.
B. An example of CAP target selection is as follows:
   If an air strike has 10 escort fighters and 20 bombers, then each CAP
   fighter will have a 33% chance of selecting an escort fighter for a target
   and a 67% chance of selecting a bomber for a target.
C. The following table shows the chances for a CAP fighter to destroy each type
   of aircraft and the chances of a counterattack destroying the CAP fighter:

                        Aircraft                Aircraft Shoots
                       Shot Down                Down CAP Fighter

    The odds for fighter combat may be changed in situations where the CAP
fighters greatly outnumber the escort fighters.  The CAP kill percentage may
be increased up to 25% and the escorts' kill percentage reduced to as low as
15%.  the following aircraft are fighters: ME109, SPITFIRE AND FULMAR.
D. Each bomber that survives CAP combat will select a target ship from those
   in the target TF and attempt to penetrate the TFs flak and deliver its
   ordnance.  Target selection is accomplished in the following manner, each
   ship is assigned a selection value (SV) equal to its defense factor plus
   five times its cargo/aircraft capacity; the chance of a particular ship
   being attacked is equal to the SV of that ship divided by the combined SV
   of the target TF.
E. The chance of a bomber being shot down by flak is equal to the TF flak
   strength, divided by 500.  The TF flak strength is equal to the combined
   AA ratings of all ships in the TF.  If there are more than 12 ships in the
   TF, then the TF flak strength is equal to the average AA ratings of the
   ships in the TF times 12.
F. The chance of bomber hitting its targets is affected by (1) bomber accuracy,
   (2) maximum speed of target, (3) flak intensity, (4) range of the strike,
   (5) size of the target.  The relative accuracy of each bomber is listed
   below:

   DO17         1       JU88       2       SWORDFISH       4*
   SM79         1*      BEAUFORT   2*      JU87            4

   * indicates torpedo ordnance

   All bombers are equally accurate when attacking enemy bases.  Air strikes
   against bases can only destroy parked aircraft or supply dumps.
G. the first air strike on any particular submarine will cause the submarine
   to submerge.  The act of submerging will protect the submarine from further
   air attacks during that turn.

8.3 Surface Combat Resolution:
-----------------------------
    Surface combat may occur between opposing TF's that occupy the same space
if at least one of the TF's performing a combat patrol mission (C) and
endurance of a least 9.

A. Surface combat is resolved using the following sequence.
(1) each British ship in a TF performing a "C" mission will fire at one of the
ships from one of the Axis TFs in the same space, (2) each Axis ship that
occupies the same space as the attacking British TF will fire at one of the
ships from the attacking TF, (3) each Axis ship in a TF performing a "C"
mission will fire at one of the ships from any British TF that occupies the
same space; (4) each British ship that occupies the same space as the
attacking Axis TF will fire at one of the ships from the attacking TF.

B. Target selection for surface combat is similar to that used for air attacks.
In surface combat, a ship's selection value is equal to that ship's defense
factor.

C. When attacking, each ship will (1) fire torpedoes, (2) fire main guns,
(3) fire secondary guns.  Ships carrying 12 or more torpedoes will fire half of
them at the target.  Ships carrying less than 12 torpedoes will fire all of them
at the target.

D. The accuracy of gunfire and torpedoes is adjusted according to the speed and
size of the target.  Axis ships will suffer a major disadvantage in surface
combat that occurs at night.  There is a 67% chance that an Axis ship will fail
to locate a target at night.  This rule does not apply to Axis MTBs.

E. The following restrictions apply during daylight surface combat: (1) AA guns
will not fire at ships with main guns; (2) torpedoes will only be fired at
crippled ships.  MTB's will fire torpedoes normally.

F. TRs, TKs, and CV type ships will never fire during surface combat.  A ship
that picks a carrier as its target will only fire if it has a speed greater
than the carrier.

G. A TF performing an "MT" (Motor Torpedo Boat) mission will perform exactly
like a TF performing a "C" mission except that an "MT" TF may initiate combat
regardless of its endurance.

H. MTBs have their torpedo accuracy doubled at night MTBs may only be damaged
by enemy gunfire.  (Enemy aircraft will employ strafing instead of bombs or
torpedoes).

I. On PM turns, MTBs selected as targets will have a 50% chance of evading the
attack (the attacker ship will not fire).

J. Combat ships (BB,CA,CL,DD,DE,DMS,DML) that are loaded with supplies will
have their surface combat efficiency reduced.  There is a 50% chance that
loaded combat ships will be unable to fire at a target during surface combat.


8.4 Submarine Combat:
--------------------
A. Submarines patrol an area up to two spaces away from their actual TF
location.

B. Each sub in a TF will have about a 12% chance of attacking an enemy surface
TF within its patrol area.  (Italian subs have a 1% chance).  Each sub in a
TF will have less than 1% chance of attacking an enemy sub TF within its
patrol area.

C. The chance of engaging and torpedoing an enemy ship will be reduced by the
number of escorts (DD,DMS, DML,DE) present in the defending TF.

D. A sub that has been sighted by enemy sub search will have its chance for
successful attack reduced and its chance of being sunk by "depth charge"
increased.

E. When attacking submarines will fire a salvo of 4 torpedoes, or all of
their remaining torpedoes, whichever is less.

F. Italian submarine torpedoes will be only half as effective as British and
German torpedoes.

G. After a submarine launches an attack, escorts in the opposing TF will
attempt to locate and depth charge the sub.  Each escort in the TF has a 15%
chance of locating the sub for Italian escorts and a 30% chance of locating
the sub for British escorts.  Escorts that locate the sub have a 1% chance of
sinking it.


8.5 Aircraft Returning to Base:
------------------------------
A. After completing their missions aircraft will attempt to return to the same
base or carrier from which they were launched.

B. If launched from a carrier which received a 26% or more damage or had its
speed reduced below 15 knots, the aircraft will try to make an "emergency"
landing on another carrier or airbase.

C. Emergency landings will occur automatically if there is a friendly base or
carrier within 3 squares of the origin carrier.

D. If an emergency landing is required and there are no eligible bases or
carriers within 3 squares, then the aircraft will ditch in the ocean.


8.6 Land Combat:
---------------
    Land combat is automatic when Axis forces are present on Malta.  Land
combat in North Africa must be planned at the end of the previous Movement
Phase.

A. when Axis forces are present on Malta, they will automatically launch a
level 5 attack against the British Malta Garrison.  The Axis force will
consume 5 supply units in this attack, and the British force will consume 1
supply unit if the Axis force does not have the required supply units for thus
level of attack, then Axis casualties will be doubled.  If the British force
does not have the required supply unit, then the British defensive fire will
be normal.  Due to fortifications, British troops on Malta will suffer only
1/4 casualties.  the British garrison may surrender if it is attacked (but do
not expect this to happen until the British are greatly reduced in strength).

B.  Land attack procedure is as follows: (1) defender forces open fire,
inflicting casualties on the attacker, (2) surviving attacker forces inflict
casualties on the defender.

C. As a general rule, the greater the attack level (1-5), the greater the
casualties on both sides.  Attacks made without adequate supplies will suffer
doubled casualties.  Defensive fire from an unsupplied force will be half as
effective.

D. In North Africa, Axis-controlled areas are colored yellow, British-controlled
areas are colored orange.  The "front line" is the junction of the yellow and
orange areas.  The front line will shift east or west depending on the outcome
of land combat in Africa.  When the front line touches the Qatar Depression.
British defensive fire will be increased by 50%.  Germany defensive fire is
always increased by 50% in North Africa.

E. British forces will automatically capture Benghazi when the front line
advances to the west of that base.  The British may never use Benghazi as a
base, but the Axis will be denied its use until the front line is pushed back
to the east of that base.

F. Axis forces will lay siege to Tobruk when the front line advanced to the
east of that base.  When this state of "siege" exists, all Afrika Corps.
attacks will be directed against the Tobruk Garrison instead of the Eighth
Army.  If the Tobruk Garrison is reduced to zero, then the Axis will capture
Tobruk and its supplies, and the British will be denied its use as a base.
The Axis may not garrison Tobruk or use it as a base.  The British will
automatically recapture  Tobruk if the front line is pushed to the west of
that base.  An Axis attack on Tobruk may result in the Garrison's immediate
"surrender".  The surrender odds are determined by the ferocity of the Axis
attack compared to the strength of the Garrison.

G. The British Malta Garrison may have enhanced defensive fire depending on
their supply status.  For each supply unit on Malta the effectiveness of their
defensive fire will increase 20% up to 1 maximum of 300%.


8.7 Ground Support and Bombardment:
---------------------------------
    The outcome of land combat may be affected by bombers performing ground
support missions and ships performing bombardment (B) missions.

A. Bombers will perform ground support missions under the following
circumstances; (1) bombers attached to the Eighth Army or Afrika Corps will
automatically perform ground support for their respective armies; (2) Tobruk-
based bombers may perform ground support when Tobruk is under siege; (3) Malta-
based bombers may perform ground support for British Forces when combat occurs
on Malta; (4) Sicily-based bombers may perform ground support for Axis forces
when combat occurs on Malta; (5) ground support bombers may not perform
search, strike, or transfer missions during the turn in which the ground
support is provided.

B. Ships in Tfs with "B" missions will provide bombardment support for friendly
forces on Malta when they occupy the Malta square.

C. Bombardment points have the same effect as ground support points.  Each
bomber provides 1 ground support point; Battleship main guns are worth 5
bombardment points each; Cruiser main guns are worth 1 bombardment point each,
all AA guns are worth 1/2 bombardment point each.  A ship with 5% or more
damage will not provide bombardment support.

D. Bombardment/Ground Support has the following effect on Land Combat; (1) each
B/GS point will "suppress", on the average, 5 companies worth of enemy
defensive/offensive fire; (2) each B/GS point will add, on the average, 2-1/2
companies worth of friendly offensive/defensive fire.

E. The Afrika Korps or Eighth Army may never receive ground support benefits
on turns during which their supplies are inadequate for full offensive or
defensive fire.  The Afrika Korps and Eighth Army are limited in the number of
bombers that may provide ground support.  The maximum support allowed each turn
is equal to 3 x SUPPLY POINTS AVAILABLE TO ARMY.  Thus, if the Afrika Korps has
50 supplies they will only use up to 150 bombers as ground support (planes over
the limit are considered to have remained on their airfields).

F. British bombers in the 8th army will provide ground support at 50% of normal
effectiveness.

G. Axis ground support and bombardment provided for troops on Malta will act at
25% effectiveness for the purposes of suppressing British defensive fire
(normal effectiveness in attack capabilities).


8.8 Advance After Combat:
------------------------
A. Following an Axis attack in North Africa the front line will "advance" one
space to the east if the Axis total combat strength (TCS) is greater than the
British TCS in North Africa.  Attacker TCS is computed as follows:
(INF COMPANIES + GROUND SUPPORT POINTS x 2) x ATTACK LEVEL.
Defender TCS is: (INF COMPANIES + GROUND SUPPORT POINTS x 2) x 3.

B. Following a British attack in North Africa, the front line will "advance"
one space to the west if the British TCS is triple (not double) or more the
Axis TCS.

C. Advance after combat will only occur following a level 4 or level 5 attack.
Advance after combat will not occur following an inadequately supplied attack.

D. The Qatar Depression is displayed on the map as a brown patch located
between Alexandria and Tobruk.  When the front line touches the Qatar
Depression, the following will occur; (1) to advance after combat, the
attacking Axis TCS must be triple or more the British TCS; (2) the effects of
British defensive fire will be doubled.


8.9 Repair and Refit of Ships:
-----------------------------
A. Damaged ships which docked during the previous movement phase are placed
in the Repair Pipeline.  Undamaged CV,BB,TR and SS type ships will be placed
in the Refit Pipeline.  Damaged CV,BB,TR,TK and SS type ships must complete
both Repair and Refit Pipeline functions before they can be reactivated.
Refit time is four days.  A TF that docks with an endurance remaining greater
30 will not be required to refit.  Transports and tankers must always refit.

B. Undamaged ships (other than those mentioned in paragraph A) which docked
during the previous movement phase, do NOT require Refit.  These ship may be
placed in a TF with a full endurance during the next TF adjustment phase.

C. The average number of turns needed for repair is equal to 9 x damage points
suffered.  The number of damage points suffered is equal to the ship's
defense factor x damage percentage.  Repair time for a ship may be doubled with
smaller ships having a greater chance of lengthened repair time (There is a
71% chance that an average DD's repair time will be doubled while and Italian
BB has only a 6% chance of requiring double repair time.)


8.10 Reinforcement Arrival:
--------------------------
    Ship reinforcements will arrive on a day-to-day basis as scheduled on the
pipeline display.  Infantry, supply, and aircraft reinforcements will be as
follows:

    Option          Location         Inf Co         Supply      Spitfire
      (1)           Gibraltar           5             20           12
      (2)           Alexandria         45             30           18

    Option          Location        Swordfish      Beaufort      Boston
      (1)           Gibraltar           0              2            0
      (2)           Alexandria          0              0           18

    Option          Location         Inf Co         Supply        ME109
      (3)             Italy            10             25             9
      (4)             Italy             0             20             9

    Option          Location          SM79           JU88          Ju87
      (3)             Italy             0              6             3
      (4)             Italy             6              0             0


A. Each turn there is a 1/8 chance of arrival for each of the above listed
reinforcement options.

B. Boston Bombers arrive attached to the Eighth Army.

C. There is a 50% chance that the Pedestal Convoy reinforcements will become
available to the British player earlier then they were historically (August
10th).  If they arrive earlier, then the Axis player will receive 2 points for
each day of earlier arrival.  This rule applies only to the Campaign game.

D. During the first week of the Campaign game the British are more likely to
receive reinforcements in Alexandria than they are later on.  During the second
and third weeks of July the Germans are more likely to receive reinforcements
in Italy.


9.0 GENERAL OPERATIONS
======================

9.1 Damage to ships:
-------------------
    Ships accrue damage "points" when they are hit by bombs, torpedoes or
gunfire.  When the total damage points are greater than or equal to ship's
defensive factor (DF), that ship will sink.  When total damage points are
greater than or equal to 50% of a ship's DF, that ship is "crippled".

A. A table listing the average damage points caused by each type of weapon is
shown below:

Light (AA) gun     0.5      BB main gun          7
CL main gun        1        Bomb                 3
CA main gun        2        Torpedo              5

B. Torpedo hits will reduce a ship's maximum speed by at least 5 knots.

C. Whenever a ship is hit, it may suffer additional damage due to a critical
hit.  The message "EXPLOSION ON BOARD ..." reveals that a critical hit has
been scored.

D. CV class ships with 26% or more damage or maximum speed less than 15 knots
may not launch or land aircraft.  Note: This means that carriers in TFs reduced
to 5 knots due to zero endurance will not be able to launch aircraft.

E. Crippled ships may accrue additional damage while returning to port.  Major
additional damage will be shown by the message "EXPLOSION ON BOARD ..."  It is
also possible for a ship to repair itself while at sea.  Repairs will be
attempted until a ship is no longer crippled.


9.2 TF Mission:
--------------
   Listed below are the missions that may be assigned to a TF and the endurance
allowed for each mission:

       Mission                     Endurance
C  - Combat Patrol               40 turns (20 days)
B  - Bombardment                 40 turns
T  - Transport                   40 turns
E  - Evacuation                  40 turns
ES - Emergency Supply            40 turns
U  - Submarine                   60 turns
MT - Motor Torpedo Boat           6 turns
R  - Return                      NA

A. CV type ships may only perform "C" missions.

B. TR type ships may only perform "T" missions or "E" missions.

C. SS type ships may only perform "U" missions.

D. MTB type ships may only perform "MT" missions.

E. Only TFs with "C" or "MT" mission may initiate surface combat.  A TF with a
"C" mission may only initiate combat if its endurance is greater than 8.

F. Surface combat may cause a Bombardment (B) TF to abort its mission.  Aborted
bombardment TFs will have their mission changed to "R".

G. An evacuation (E) TF that loads troops during the movement phase will have
its mission changed to "T".  It may then unload these troops at any base.
(Note: To load troops, an evacuation TF must begin its move on a friendly base
square - press (9) to dock and all transports in the TF will automatically load
friendly troops up to their capacity).

H. All ships present in an evacuation TF will have the capacity to transport
troops.  Any ship with a cargo capacity of zero will have its capacity
increased at the moment it is placed in the "E" TF (in-port only).  The
adjusted cargo capacity will be equal to the ship's DF divided by 6 (fractions
dropped).

I. Emergency Supply missions may only be performed by ships with a speed of at
least 25 knots and a DF of at least 6.  Ships included in an ES mission will be
automatically loaded with supply units.  Ships that normally have a capacity of
zero will instead have a capacity equal to their DF divided by 6 for ES
missions only.  Ships in an ES mission will only load up 1/5 of a supply point
per supply capacity.  When the ships unload they will only unload 1/5 of a
supply point per point listed as its capacity.  Example: One CL with a DF of 23
and 4 DD's with a DF of 7 form an ES mission.  They will load (and unload) a
total of 2 supplies ((3+1+1+1+1)/5 rounded up), although the ships will show
that they are carrying 7 supplies.  ES missions may not combine with non-ES
missions.


9.3 TF Endurance:
----------------
A. A TFs endurance is reduced by one for each turn that it spends at sea.  A
TF that ends its move in a harbor will not have endurance reduced.

B. A TFs endurance is reduced to 15 if the TF is attacked by enemy bombers.  If
the endurance is already less than 15, then it is unaffected.  Transport and
Evacuation TFs will never be reduced.

C. A carrier TFs endurance will be reduced by 5% for each airstrike that it
launches.

D. A Bombardment TF will have its endurance reduced by 10% for each turn that
it provides bombardment support.  If the endurance falls below 9 due to this
reduction then the TFs mission will be changed to "R".  A bombardment group
with endurance less than 9 may not provide bombardment support.

E. Surface Combat reduces endurance as follows: The attacking TFs endurance is
reduced to 8 (if currently greater than 8) if the defending TFs combined
defensive factors multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1 is greater than
25.  The defending TFs endurance is reduced to 8 (if currently greater than 8)
if the total attacker main guns multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1
is greater than 15.  For these purposes, the MG of a battleship is multiplied
by 4 (battleships will lend to scare off enemy TFs).

F. If a TFs endurance reaches zero and it fails to dock during that turn, then
all of its ships will have their maximum speed reduced to 5 knots.

G. Subs with zero endurance may not fire torpedoes.


9.4 Supply:
----------
   Supply units are used for (1) Infantry daily supply; (2) land combat; (3)
Forming TFs; (4) performing air missions.

A. Bases and front line armies must spend daily supplies to maintain their
troops.  The daily supply cost for each base or army is equal to the number of
infantry companies divided by 150 fractions rounded up.  EXAMPLE: An army of
330 infantry companies must have 3 supply units for daily supply (330/150 =
2.2, rounded up to 3).  Bases or armies that have supply levels inadequate to
meet daily supply requirements will lose 1% of their infantry strength per day,
fractions rounded up.  Gibraltar, Alexandria, Italy and Sicily are exempted
from daily supply requirements.

B. Supplies are consumed in land combat.  Land combat on Malta will consume 5
Axis supply dumps and 1 British supply dump.  Attacker forces in North Africa
will consume 1 supply dump for each level of attack while defender forces will
consume 1 supply dump regardless of the attack level.  Attacker casualties will
be doubled when there is inadequate supply for the level of attack.  Defensive
fire will be halved if the defending force does not have the required supply
unit.

C. The major ports (Italy, Gibraltar and Alexandria) must have adequate
supplies to form ships into TFs.  The cost of placing a ship in a TF is equal
to 1/5 of that ship's DF (fractions rounded down).
   Thus, an Italian Battleship requires 16 supply points (81/5 = 16.2 = 16) and
a MTB requires 0 supply points (2/5 = 4 = 0).  If a port runs out of supply
points as you are forming a TF, then you will not be allowed to place any more
ships in that TF.

D. A TF that returns to port with an endurance greater than 20 will return its
unused "fuel" to the port.  The quantity of fuel (supply) returned is equal to
each ship's DF divided by 10 (fractions rounded down).

E. Airbases consume 1 supply point for each airstrike launched.  CAP, search
and transfer  missions do not consume supply points.  If a base's supply level
falls below 3, then no air operations will be permitted from that base.


9.5 Scoring:
-----------
A. Players receive victory points (VPs) for sinking enemy ships equal to that
ship's Defense Factor plus its cargo/aircraft capacity.  Players receive 1 VP
for each damage point inflicted on an enemy ship at sea at the end of the game.
Players also receive 1 VP for each week a ship is out of action at the end of
the game.  However, they do not receive points for the first one week that a
ship is out of action at the end of a game.  (This allows time for refitting
as opposed to repair time).  In campaigns that end before August 10, no victory
points will be awarded for damaged ships in the pipeline.

B. The British Player received 1 VP for each infantry company in the Eighth
Army or Tobruk at the end of the game.  The Axis Player receives 1 VP for each
infantry company in the Afrika Corps at the end of the game.

C. The players receive VPs for possession of geographical objectives.  The
British Player receives points for controlling the followings:

MALTA   - 500    ALEXANDRIA - 500   TOBRUK - 500    TRIPOLI - 500

The Axis players receives points for controlling the following:

ALEXANDRIA - 1000   MALTA - 200   TOBRUK - 200

D. The game ends immediately if the Axis player captures Alexandria.  The game
will end immediately if the British player captures Tripoli.  The game will
automatically end after the August 31 PM turn.

E. The Current score is summarized at the beginning of each turn.

F. Subtract British VPs from the Axis VPs and compare the results to the
following table to determine the victor:

       1000 and up   Axis Decisive Victory
        500 to 999   Axis Substantive Victory
        100 to 499   Axis Marginal Victory
         -99 to 99   Draw
      -499 to -100   British Marginal Victory
      -999 to -500   British Substantive Victory
    -1000 and less   British Decisive Victory


9.6 Weather:
------------
   There are three levels of weather: clear, partly cloudy, and cloudy.  The
weather will be cloudy at the start of the campaign.
A. Weather will influence the ability to spot enemy TFs at ranges greater than
1.5.  The chance of spotting TFs at ranges over 1.5 is reduced by 1/3 during
partly cloudy and 2/3 during cloudy weather.
B. There is a random chance each turn that the weather will change.  The
weather is graduated such that in any one turn the weather should not change
from clear to cloudy, it would have to change to partly cloudy before it could
become cloudy.  The weather can change a maximum of one level per turn.
C. There is a chance that airstrikes against enemy shipping will fail to locate

and weather type:

9.7 Airbase Capacity:
---------------------
   The maximum aircraft capacity for each airbase is listed below:

Gibraltar          500            Italy         500
Alexandria         500            Sicily        500
Tobruk             200            Sardinia      500
Malta              300            Crete         500
Tripoli            500            Benghazi      100

A. The JU52s are ignored when computing the maximum allowed at an airbase.


10.0 MINI-GAMES
===============
   BOMB ALLEY includes 2 mini-games: Pedestal and Crete.  Due to their limited
scope, each mini-game includes some special rules and restrictions.

10.1 Pedestal Exclusive Rules:
------------------------------
   Rules for the Pedestal mini-game are the same as those for the Campaign,
with the following exceptions:

A. Scoring: In addition to the scoring outlined in section 9.5 (Exception: No
points are awarded for possession of geographical objectives), the British
player receives 10 VPs for each supply unit on Malta at the end of the game.
The Axis player receives 5 VPs for each supply unit controlled by the Afrika
Corps and 1 VP for each supply unit in Italy at the end of the game.  Players
do not receive points for geographical objectives in the Pedestal mini-game.
Also, all VPs scored are doubled after the conclusion of the game.  Each
player receives 1 victory point per plane remaining all the end of the game
(not including JU52 aircraft).

B. The weather is clear at the start of the game.

10.2 Crete Exclusive Rules:
---------------------------
   Rules for the Crete mini-game are the same as the rules for the Campaign,
with the following exceptions:

A. The Axis player may only form new TFs or dock TFs in Athens.  The Axis
player may operate aircraft from Athens (capacity = 500) and Molaoi (capacity
= 500).  The British airbase on Crete is #3.  The British Airbase on Malta is
#1.  The Axis player may operate aircraft from Crete only after the Axis
forces have captured an airfield on that island.

B. An airborne assault will occur the first time during the game in which
Molaoi-based JU52s are included in an airstrike against Crete.  All rules
discussed in section 7.6 apply here - simply change Sicily to mean Molaoi and
Malta to mean Crete.

C. The Axis forces will capture an airfield on Crete if following the land
combat phase the Axis Total Combat Strength (TCS) on Crete is greater than the
British TCS.  For this scenario the Axis TCS is equal to INF COMPANIES +
GROUND SUPPORT POINTS X RANDOM NUMBER (between 0 and 1), the British TCS is
equal to INF COMPANIES + GROUND SUPPORT POINTS X RANDOM NUMBER + SUPPLY UNITS.

D. The British forces may recapture an Axis-held airfield if following the
land combat phase the British TCS is ten or more times greater than the Axis
TCS.

E. If Axis forces begin a land combat phase on Crete, they must attack the
British Garrison.  The Axis player will consume 5 supply units in this attack,
the British player will consume 1 supply unit (see section 8.6 C for the
effects of inadequate supply).

F. Scoring Points awarded for sinking or damaging ships are the same as in
section 9.5 A.  If the Axis player controls an airfield on Crete at the end of
the game, then "Strategic Points" are awarded in the following manner.  The
Axis player scores 2 points for each infantry company on Crete, the British
player scores 1 point for each infantry company in Alexandria (it pays for the
British to evacuate his troops if he loses the airfield).  If the Axis player
does not control an airfield on Crete at the end of the game, then Strategic
Points are awarded as follows: the British player scores 500 points plus 1
point for each infantry company on Crete; the Axis player scores 1 point for
each infantry company in Athens.  (It pays for the Axis to evacuate his troops
from Crete if he will be unable to capture the airfield).

G. During this scenario only, the Axis player may use the AUTO-LOAD TRANSPORTS
function.  When employed, this function will automatically load infantry into
all eligible empty transports in Athens.  If you wish some of the transports to
carry supplies, they should be manually loaded prior to using the AUTO-LOAD
TRANSPORTS function.

H. During this scenario only, the Axis player may use the AUTO-FORM TF function
.  When employed this function will automatically form all eligible ships in
Athens into one TF.  The mission for an AUTO FORM TF must be "T" or "E".

I. Air Combat over Crete will occur each AM turn in which Axis troops have a
foothold on Malta.  The Air combat will follow the sequence listed below:
(1) Molaoi-based long-range CAP will attack Crete-based bombers and fighters
available for ground support missions.
(2) Crete-based long-range CAP will attack Molaoi-based bombers and fighters
available for ground support missions.
(3) Crete-based long-range CAP will attack Athens-based bombers and fighters
available for ground support missions.

J. Only JU52 aircraft may be transferred to a captured German airbase on Crete.

K. German transports do not have to refit after returning to ports.

L. The weather will be CLEAR at the start of the game.

M. Ground support/bombardment provided for forces on Crete will be greatly
reduced in effectiveness (and yet still quite powerful).

10.3 Mini-Game Duration:
------------------------
   Mini-games will end after a specified number of turns.  Mini-game durations
are as follows: Pedestal - 12 turns, Crete - 24 turns.

10.4 Mini-Game Levels of Victory:
---------------------------------
   The computer will automatically DOUBLE the points scored by each player
prior to computing the level of victory.  The adjusted point totals may then be
applied to the table in 9.5 F.


11.0 SOLITAIRE PLAY
===================
   When playing solitaire games, the computer will command the British Forces.

A. There are 4 levels of solitaire difficulty.  The level of difficulty in
determined at the start of the game.  At level 3, the British will perform
according to their historical accuracy.  As the level number is decreased, the
British bomber, torpedo, and gunfire accuracy will increase.  These levels may
be used to handicap a two-player game if desired.

B. It is possible to start a game in solitaire mode, save it, and then restart
it as a two-player game.  To do this set the main menu to two-player mode
before restarting the saved game.

C. It is possible to save a two-player game and restart it as a solitaire game
when using the following restriction: All British TFs must end the two player
segment IN-PORT.

12.0 TWO-PLAYER GAMES
=====================
   When using the two-player format, the following procedure should be observed

A. While the Axis player is giving commands to his forces, the British player
should turn away or leave the room.

B. While the British player is giving commands to his forces, the Axis player
should turn away or leave the room.

C. During the combat resolution phase, both players should view the results.

15.0 STRATEGY NOTES
===================

AXIS STRATEGY
-------------
   Axis strategy should aim for the eventual collapse of Alexandria as this is
the only likely means of achieving a decisive victory.  There are three basic
approaches to the Alexandria strategy: (1) Ignore Malta and commit all Axis
resources towards an immediate North African blitzkrieg; (2) Suppress Malta
(destroy all supplies and aircraft) through continuous air attack prior to
launching the North African offensive; (3) Capture Malta through airborne and
amphibious assault prior to launching the North African offensive.

SUPPRESSING MALTA
-----------------
   Suppressing Malta is a two-phase operation that requires (1) the reduction
of Malta's fighter strength and (2) the destruction of Malta's supplies.  Phase
1 can be accomplished by launching Sicily and Tripoli-based fighter sweeps to
attrition the Spitfires down to a manageable level.  The sweeps should
include enough ME109s to equal or outnumber Malta's Spitfires and no more than
a handful of bombers.
   In Phase 2 of the suppression the Axis player can launch formations of 100
or more bombers to attack Malta's supply dumps.  These attacks should include
a substantial fighter escort as long as Malta can put Spitfires in the air.
When supplies have been reduced below 3.  Malta's aircraft will be unable to
fly and may be destroyed on the ground.  Suppression of Malta will usually
require 2 to 3 weeks and a loss to the Axis of approximately 100 fighters and
40 bombers.  Malta will recover quickly from the suppression unless the Axis
is successful in its blockade.

THE BLOCKADE
------------
   The Axis player has a powerful mix of air, submarine, MTB and heavy surface
units available to blockade Malta.  With proper coordination and a little luck
the Axis forces can devastate even the best protected of British convoys.
   Axis air and submarine forces must be divided to guard both the eastern and
western approaches to Malta.  Bombers based in Sardinia and Crete are
positioned to take early shots at the British convoys.  British ships slowed by
damage near the start of their journey have almost no chance of reaching Malta.
Bombers based in Sicily or Tripoli can guard both the eastern and western
approaches to Malta but they often take frightful losses from Malta-based CAP.
Sicily and Tripoli-based bombers usually inflict their greatest damage after
the British transports have unloaded their cargo.
   Axis submarines should be positioned in the areas south of Crete and south
of Sardinia.  These submarines will be well-positioned to pounce on ships
crippled by air attacks.  The submarine TFs should contain 6-10 subs with at
least 2 U-boats included.  Although their numbers are impressive, the Italian
submarines will usually perform poorly.
   The Axis forces are guaranteed one shot at the British convoys before they
enter Malta's harbor.  The Axis player should form two surface TFs: one
containing all available BB, CA, CL and DD units and one containing all
available MTB units.  The heavy surface TF should seek combat only during
daylight turns.  The MTB force should only seek combat during night turns.  The
point of interception is the Malta square as all British TFs must stop there
before entering the harbor.

SUPPLYING THE AFRIKA KORPS
--------------------------
   Supplying the Afrika Korps will require weekly convoys from Italy to Africa.
The Afrika Korps consumes about 40 supply dumps a week when doing nothing and
75 supply dumps a week during an all-out offensive.  The Axis may air-transport
21 supply dumps per week into Africa.
   The Axis player can usually achieve victory in the first month if the flow
of supplies into Africa is unrestricted.  To achieve the unrestricted flow of
supplies the Axis player must suppress Malta.  The suppression of Malta
requires the transfer of vital air strength out of the Afrika Korps, which
makes it costly to suppress Malta and attack in North Africa at the same time.
   The Axis player is confronted with the same strategic decisions that
confronted Hitler, Mussolini and Rommel in the summer of 1942: Immediately
pursue the weakened Eighth Army and possibly break through to Alexandria ?
Suppress Malta first to take the pressure off the supply convoys ?  Attempt to
capture Malta and secure the supply line once and for all ?

AXIS SUPPLY CONVOYS
-------------------
   Axis supply convoys should contain approximately 2 CLs, 10 DDs, 2 DEs and
all available TRs and TKs.  Transport space should not be wasted with infantry
since infantry can be flown into Africa in sufficient quantities.
   Tripoli is usually the safest of destination harbor for the supply convoys;
the route is shorter and almost entirely within range of Sicily or Tripoli CAP.
Benghazi is closer to the front line so fewer supplies will be consumed in
transit.  Also, due to its greater distance from Malta, Benghazi harbor may be
a safer place to unload the cargo.

ASSAULT ON MALTA
----------------
   The assault on Malta should be a combined airborne and amphibious operation.
The amphibious TF should plot a "T" mission and contain all available
transports loaded with 50% troops and 50% supplies.  The screen for the
amphibious force should be the same as for an Axis supply convoy.  The Axis
should also include for this operation a bombardment TF consisting of all
remaining BB, CA, CL and DD units.
   The Axis paratroops should be dropped on the same turn that the amphibious
TF unloads on Malta.  As long as opposition remains on Malta the Sicily-based
bombers should restrict their anti-ship and anti-base missions to ensure
adequate ground support for the assault.  The bombardment force should loiter
in the Malta square until its endurance falls below 9.  The assault will be
successful if the following conditions are met: (1) the Malta garrison remains
unsupplied; (2) the assault force is kept in supply; (3) Axis bombardment and
ground support are continuous and heavy.

BRITISH STRATEGY
----------------
   The British hold Alexandria at all cost; failure to do this will probably
result in an Axis decisive victory.  The best way to stop the Axis in Africa
is to maintain a potent air force on Malta.  To remain effective as a base.
Malta must receive periodic air reinforcements and supplies.  After the Axis
captures Tobruk the British may no longer fly reinforcements directly from a
base into Malta.  Spitfires may be flown from aircraft carriers into Malta if
the carriers are within 15 spaces of Malta.

BRITISH SUPPLY CONVOYS
----------------------
    British supply convoys to Malta will lose 60-100% of their participating
transport.  Convoy operations are so costly that the British can only afford
2 or 3 of them per campaign game.  Convoy operations should employ all
available transports and escorts.  Carrier TFs may be used to escort the
convoys and provide fighter cover.  The carriers should only be used for cover
when 3 or more of them are available.

EMERGENCY SUPPLY MISSIONS
-------------------------
   When supplies run low on Malta and there are not enough transports to send
a normal supply convoy, the British must use cruisers and destroyers on an
emergency supply mission.  An "ES" TF should contain about 4 cruisers and 8
destroyers.  The British have enough ships to send 3 or 4 emergency supply TFs
at once.

ASSAULT ON MALTA - BRITISH REACTION
-----------------------------------
   When the Axis paratroopers land on Malta the British may perform the
following actions to thwart the invasion: (1) resupply Malta with "ES" missions
; (2) send Combat TFs to intercept the Axis bombardment TFs; (3) send British
bombardment TFs to support the Malta garrison.
   A successful "ES" mission is the surest way to defeat the invasion; a
supplied British garrison will inflict heavy casualties on the attackers.  The
bombardment effect of the two Axis TF battleships is equal to 90 ground support
bombers; therefore it may be desirable to use a Combat Patrol TF to engage
Axis bombardment forces and send them home.  The British should only send a
bombardment TF if one or more battleships are available.  The British player
should not hesitate to commit the bulk of his fleet in reaction to the Axis
invasion.  Although the loss in ships will be high, the Axis cannot effectively
attack all of them at once.  The flak density of the pure combat TFs (as
opposed to transport TFs) will inflict heavy casualties on the attacking
bombers and distract them from their ground support role.

ATTACKING AXIS SUPPLY CONVOYS
-----------------------------
   The Swordfish and Beauforts based on Malta are the hub of the British
anti-shipping force.  These valuable aircraft are best employed against Axis
supply convoys.  They should be used sparingly against high CAP or flak density
targets.  The British should maintain 2 or 3 submarine TFs in the central
Mediterranean at all times.  A good place to pounce on an Axis convoy is near
the entrance to a North African harbor.  Ships torpedoed off the African coast
will seldom make it back to Italy.
   At least once during the game the British player should attempt to intercept
an Axis convoy with a surface combat TF.  It is possible for the British to
form a cruiser-destroyer force in Alexandria or Gibraltar and send it to the
central Mediterranean.  Such a force could remain in Malta harbor during the
day (under a powerful CAP umbrella) and prowl the Axis shipping lanes of night.

17.0 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY
     MALTA: ROCK IN A HARD PLACE
     By Robert S. Billings
================================

   On the 21st of June, 1942, General Erwin Rommel had achieved the victory for
which his Afrika Korps had been fighting in the desert for many long months.
Tobruk had at last fallen to his lightning assault.  And with Tobruk captured,
the dream of an advance to the British naval base at Alexandria, and even to
Cairo and the Suez Canal beyond, had suddenly ceased to be a desert mirage and
had become a reality awaiting merely a leader hold enough to bring it to
fruition.
   The desert war, with its armored jousting, its hundreds of tanks and
vehicles racing across the blazing sands up and down the North African coast in
attacks and retreats lasting for hundreds of miles, had always been a war of
supply.  for those hundreds of tanks and vehicles seemed always mad with thirst
- for petrol and ammunition, for replacement tanks and vehicles, for provisions
for the men for whom these "brazen chariots" had become master, slave, and often
enough, blazing coffin as well.  With all the glamour of racing maneuver and
tactical skill, victory most often came down to a simple matter of supply - the
winner was whoever could replace destroyed tanks first and keep them fueled for
maneuver.  Now, with the sudden capture of Tobruk, a veritable cornucopia of
supply had been opened to the Desert Fox.
   The capture came so unexpectedly that there had been no time for the British
to destroy the vast storehouse of supplies they had accumulated there.  Now it
was all Rommel's the glory, the 30,000 prisoners, the 1400 tons of petrol,
the replacement vehicles (2,000 of them), the ammunition (German as well as
British).
   It was these supplies, in addition to the state of his troops (flushed with
a clear-cut victory that has sent the British Eighth Army scampering back into
Egypt) which could make the General's dream possible - a final victory in the
desert to crown the glorious victories that had just won him promotion to
Field Marshal.  It was all waiting - but it would require, he felt, a leader of
boldness and vision who would take the gambit, who would not shrink from
another spin of battle's wheel of fortune.
   Mussolini, of course could stop him.  The Italian dictator, in nominal
command of the war in North Africa, could insist Rommel stick to the original
plan: first the brilliant desert victory, driving the British back to Egypt;
then a shift of emphasis, direction, and air support to the little clean-up job
that had been waiting now for years.  Malta! A small piece of real estate in
the middle of the Mediterranean.  A chunk of rock overlaid with soil a few
miles off the coast of Sicily, closer to Italy than Africa, intimidated by
hundreds of bombings, starving and unprovisioned, nearly ready, so far as the
Axis leaders could tell, to surrender.  Hitler and Mussolini had met on April
30 and set July 10 as D-Day for the final assault on that impotent little patch
of dirt.  That was now hardly more than two weeks away.  There would be just
time - If Rommel would call a halt to his operations and shift all his air
power and other needed forces toward Malta.  But that should not be.  Here
Rommel was poised on the final leg of a march that could virtually eliminate
the British from the Middle East.  Should such an opportunity be lost for a
minor operation against a small island now ready to fall - and no earthly good
to the British anyway, once his victorious panzers were clanking through the
streets of Cairo and lining the banks of the Suez Canal ?  Unmindful of his
earlier warnings concerning the need for eliminating Malta, Rommel sat down
and composed a message to be sent, not to his immediate Italian commander, but
to Hitler himself.  Mussolini would not dare to insist if the Fuehrer himself
decided to change the time schedule and let one of his favorite commanders
push on to Alexandria, the great British base, just a few miles away.
   Thus are made, in the rush of the moment and by the advice of eager,
ego ridden battle commanders, decisions to come back later to haunt first the
commanders themselves, and later the historians and strategists poring over
the documents and endlessly wondering "What if .. ?"
   To fully understand the events of that crucial summer of 1942 in the
Mediterranean, one must be aware of the geography of the area and the history
of the war in that theater.  The Mediterranean was first of all a long naval
battlefield with British power clustered at only three points in the west end
at Gibraltar, where Naval Force it was stationed; in the east at the fine
harbor at Alexandria, not far from Cairo; and, finally, in one small island.
Malta, nearly midway (both east-west and north-south) in the Mediterranean.
Dwarfed by the neighboring island of Sicily, Malta could launch, at the
beginning of the war, torpedo planes to range over a two-hundred-mile circle
in the precise area where transports and supplies would have to pass should
they take the shortest route from Italy to North Africa.  And with the increase
in the range of torpedo planes, this circle kept expanding until, by the end
of 1942, it was eight hundred miles in diameter and covered all of Sicily,
much of Italy, Sardina, and North Africa, and even touched the western coast of
Greece.  By this point in the war, then it was almost literally impossible
for an Axis convoy to sail to North Africa without passing through this circle
- without spending, in fact, the largest portion of its voyage within it.
   But of course that worked two ways.  Malta itself was extremely vulnerable
to attack - especially to waves of airplanes attacking from the many airfields
to Sicily.  Whenever German airpower began operations against it, the island's
use as an offensive base quickly diminished, and life on Malta was forced to
become a life underground.  And if it was to remain a point of British power,
it had to be supplied regularly with fuel and ammunition for the submarines,
the planes, the ships and the anti-aircraft batteries based there.
   Malta's fortunes had risen and fallen with the British fortunes of war in
the theater as a whole.  When the power of the British navy seemed in rule
supreme on the Mediterranean.  Malta could be well-provisioned and used as an
offensive base for deadly air raids, submarine attacks, and even surface-ship
battles; but when the Axis air power increased and its army faced along the
North African coast toward a beckoning Egypt, the ships had to leave, the
submarines had to sneak in for rest and repair at night and remain submerged
during the day, the planes so laboriously brought in were often destroyed on
the ground before getting a chance at the enemy.
   For the war in North Africa had indeed been a wildly shifting one.  At first
Italy had seemed to have the far superior force overshadowing the puny British
force of 30,000 men under General Wavell in Egypt.  Yet the Italian force
turned out to be a paper tiger, despite its vast numbers.  Early in December,
1940, General Wavell's troops attacked.  He had fewer than 225 tanks, far
fewer than the Italians, but of far better quality.  And in just two months his
troops had advanced nearly 600 miles, defeating the Italians and chasing them
past Bardia, Tobruk, Derna, and even Benghazi.  His small force had captured
130,000 men and 400 tanks at an astonishingly low total cost of 2,000 British
casualties.
   Just a month before, the British navy had had its own glorious victory.  On
November 11 the carrier ILLUSTRIOUS had sailed from Alexandria with 24
Swordfish torpedo planes.  On the night of November 11-12, 170 miles from the
base at Taranto where the Italian battleships were moored, the first of two
flights of planes took off carrying torpedoes, bombs, and illuminating flares.
At 2300 the first flares were dropped over the Italian fleet, and the planes
maneuvered between barrage-balloon cables and dove in to drop their bombs and
torpedoes.  All aircraft except two had returned to the carrier by 0250.  They
had left behind three Italian battleships sunk; one out of action for the
entire war, and two more that could not be raised and repaired for six months.
   These were heady days for the Royal Navy, for the British Army, and for
Malta.  A year that had begun with defeat in Europe, had passed through the
bombings of London and the Specter of a German invasion, had finally ended in
a glow of triumph.  But events were to show it was a temporary glow only.
   Hitler had decided that he would have to go to the relief of his over-
extended partner, who not only had lost an army in North Africa, but had
decided to invade Greece as well - with no more success.  So the Tenth Air
Fleet of the Luftwaffe was sent to Sicily.  And the bold tank commander who had
led the way across France, General Erwin Rommel, was dispatched, with the
beginnings of what was to become the Afrika Korps, to take command on the North
African coast.  And on March 31, 1941, he struck.
   Wavell, never possessing much actual strength had meanwhile lost most of
what he had possessed.  He had been asked to send a large part of his best
troops including armor, to Greece to stop an expected German invasion there.
Most of his supply vehicles had been cannibalized in this attempt, and he was
left with nothing to do but retreat - especially when confronted with an
audacious commander of great tactical skill.  In a very short time the formerly
triumphant British army was racing back toward Egypt, losing tanks as they ran
out of gas and managing to held Tobruk only by leaving a strong garrison there
among its vast assembled stores.
   And then the blow fell on Greece.  In three weeks German troops had overrun
the entire country, forcing the British soldiers to leave much of their armor
and vehicles behind as they gathered on the beaches for a desperate rescue by
the hard-pressed Royal Navy.  The British troops and armor which might have
served so well in Africa, had done absolutely no good in Greece.  And after a
German paratroop attack on Crete had succeeded, there was nothing to show for
the whole disastrous spring except huge losses in the Royal Navy for its
desperate attempts to save the remnants of the stranded expeditionary force.
   During these early days of the war.  Malta had established itself as an
important part of the British effort by its continued use as a base for attacks
on convoys and shipping proceeding from Italy to Africa.  Despite its own
initial lack of preparedness in defense, especially in numbers of planes, it
was able to continue servicing and repairing the submarines sent out to prey on
both merchant and naval ships; its docks could be used for repair of surface
vessels and even serve part of the time, as base for a smaller force of the
Royal Navy.  But although from the beginning Churchill himself had recognized
Malta's importance for the British strategic plan, there was such a need for
planes in England that for a time only a carefully measured few could be sent
to the center of the Mediterranean.  Nevertheless, as the war progressed,
greater and greater efforts were made to fill this desperate need.  A
relatively safe means to deliver these planes was worked out with carriers
loading their decks with planes to be carried part way from Gibraltar, launched
before passing through the narrow strip of water between Sicily and North
Africa, and flown to the island under their own power.
   Thus, although in April of 1941 the pounding of Malta from the air had so
neutralized the island's offensive potential that only two per cent of the
Axis supply shipping was sunk, and Rommel's force had been able to reach Africa
intact, every time the air attacks eased up.  Malta would once again make
itself felt.  By November of 1941, when the British were busy readying a new
offensive against Rommel, the losses inflicted on both supply and naval ships
of the Axis could not be ignored by the frustrated dictators.
   On the night of November 7-8, for example, an Axis convoy of seven merchant
ships on route for Africa and guarded by cruisers and destroyers was
intercepted by Force K (the surface ships based on Malta) which not only
destroyed all seven, but a destroyer as well.  And a second destroyer was sent
down with a torpedo from a British submarine.  On November 20 the same force
attacked the escort of another convoy, torpedoing a cruiser and causing the
entire convoy to be ordered back to port before it could be completely
destroyed.  Four days later the same Malta-based Force K intercepted another
convoy and sank two ships.  In fact, when the enraged Mussolini saw the total
figures for the month, he saw that 70% of all his supply ships sent out had
been destroyed.  And it was clear that little Malta was perhaps more than any
other single cause, responsible for these tremendous losses.
   Due to large part to this great loss of supplies intended for Rommel, the
British left they had gained enough advantage to take the offensive in the
desert lighting.  The British army had had the advantage of a long but
relatively safe supply route - around South Africa and up through the Red Sea
and the Suez Canal.  Rommel himself was planning a new offensive, and when the
two forces came together the tricks of the Desert Fox, while effective, could
not counter the tremendous difference in supplies, and consequently the British
finally relieved the siege of Tobruk and forced Rommel to withdraw by January
of 1942 to El Agheila.  For a brief moment it seemed that the British had
reconquered all their losses, shown their superiority to the great German
tank commander, and reasserted British power throughout the whole Mediterranean.  But this time, too, the great hopes quickly dissipated like a fading desert
mirage.
   Hitler and Mussolini had now both learned their lesson, it appeared,
concerning Malta and the supply situation in the Mediterranean.  Hitler, in a
directive dated November 17, 1944, made clear his intentions for Malta.  Field
Marshal Kesselring was made Commander-in-Chief South, he would be provided with
an entire new Air Fleet II from the Russian front, and he would be expected to
"suppress" Malta as well as take control of the Central Mediterranean Sea.
   Meanwhile, despite the good news of the North African campaign, the British
navy was suffering a series of disasters.  On 13 November a submarine torpedoed
and sank the carrier ARK ROYAL 90 miles from Gibraltar.  On the 25th another
submarine dove under the screening vessels and put torpedoes into the
battleship BARHAM, which sank within ten minutes.  And then on the 21st of
December, all three cruisers of the Malta force ran into mines - one cruiser
and an accompanying destroyer went down; the other two cruisers were badly
damaged and had to be taken out of action.  And this happened just a day after
six brave Italians had maneuvered three piloted torpedoes into the Alexandria
harbor and altered the entire naval situation in the Mediterranean by sinking
the two remaining battleships there (QUEEN ELIZABETH and VALIANT).  Thus, in
the eastern Mediterranean, the British were left with no carriers, no
battleships, and only three light cruisers as "heavy" ships.  The entire naval
struggle in the area now would have to fall on destroyers and submarines alone.
And although the two British battleships had been sunk in shallow water, it
would be a very long time before either could be raised and repaired.  So
desperate was their situation that the British tried to conceal the forces -
but by late January they had become generally known.
   The supply situation for the Axis began to change immediately.  Shortly
after an affair called the "First Battle of Sirte",  Mussolini had complained
to Hitler that although the Italians had managed to get four supply ships
through to North Africa, they had had to use 100,000 tons of warships to
protect 20,000 tons of supply ships.  It had been tremendously costly in fuel
for such an armada to protect only four ships, and shortage of fuel was one of
the big reasons the larger Italian ships had thus far been seldom used in
combat operations.  But now with the increased attention to Malta, and the
weakened position of the British Navy in the area, the Axis shipping losses
began to decline dramatically.  And by the beginning of April, Kesselring was
ready with even stronger medicine for Malta.
   With 2,000 planes under his command, the Field Marshal determined to
completely devastate the small island with nearly continuous bombing raids.
During one month alone his planes dropped 6,700 tons of bombs, concentrating
most of it on the harbor installations.  Those ships that could get out had to
leave.  Those that could not, could not stay afloat long - destroyers, mine-
layers, submarines were sunk with relative ease.  The entire island, even the
city streets, was becoming a mass of debris.  And by his target date of May
10, Kesselring felt the island had indeed been "suppressed."  To finish it off,
an airborne invasion, supported by a naval landing was planned - first for
June, but later postponed until July.
   By this time Rommel had broken loose again.  In late January in fifteen days
he had pushed all the way back to El Gazala, not far from Tobruk.  There
receiving supplies regularly now (in January not a single supply ship had been
lost), he could rest and prepare for his next step.
   Malta itself had received four supply ships in January; after that another
attempt had been made to run a convoy in, but all the supply ships had been
sunk.  From that point on there had been virtually nothing.  All supplies were
running low, and even provisions to keep the population from starving had
struck so far that the leaders were beginning to count the number of weeks they
could continue.  Malta could do almost nothing to prevent what was about to
happen in Africa.
   During the evening of May 26th, the Afrika Korps gathered its forces for the
assault; the next morning they attacked.  There followed the lighting success
described at the beginning of this account - and by June 21st Tobruk, with its
storehouse of supplies, was Rommel's nearly intact, and he was anxious to
continue the battle straight to Alexandria.
   This was one of those moments of decision that strategists hope for and at
the same time dread.  One can rarely do everything one wants to do on all
fronts.  Choices must be made.  There are never "enough" resources.  The
decision whatever it is, must take from one operation to give to another.  And
the "leader" must choose which Peter is to be robbed to pay which Paul.
   Malta had been effectively suppressed for months - yet some Axis commanders
felt it must be eliminated by invasion if the supply situation in North Africa
was not to be continually endangered.  The troops, the planes, the ships had
already been committed for that invasion and they were ready or gathering.  The
plans had been made, the day set.  The Italian Navy, starved for fuel by Hitler
during the course of the war (their only fuel supplies came from the German
Fuehrer) was at last about to be given a major role and the capability to carry
it out.  The German planes were also committed.  They could easily be pulled
from supporting Rommel and shifted north the few miles necessary.  A brief,
perhaps costly campaign, and then it would be over, and never again would the
Axis be faced with the inability to supply their African troops - all because
of that dirt-covered rock in the Mediterranean.
   Was that the way to go ?
   But there was Rommel, breaking loose and racing nearly all the way to
Alexandria.  One more little push, while the great commander and his desert
troops were high from their remarkable successes.  Perhaps that would be just
the amount necessary to lead to a breakthrough - a British rout to Alexandria
and out into the open again.  And then British power would be truly broken.
They might defend their "tight little island", but their great empire in the
Middle East would topple like nine-pins.
   Hitler was indeed between a rock and a hard place.
   But that little voice of reason-blinded-by-hope spoke up: if you give
everything to  Rommel, he can break the back of British resistance.  And then
the whole strategic situation will change.  There will be another route to the
Caucasus oil, another last-minute disastrous pull-out for what will be left of
the British troops.  And this time they will be too far away to be brought home
on sailboats and private yachts.  They will all be in the bag.
   Hitler did not hesitate.  It would be Rommel.  All supplies available would
be rushed to him.  The enthusiastic commander would be given his head.  Malta
would have to wait.  If Rommel could do what he had said he could, Malta
wouldn't matter.  It was nearly starved out, anyway.
   And so the word was rushed to Rommel.  He could attack, finish his enemy
off.  He would be supported, troops and planes diverted to him as necessary.
Mussolini had agreed.  What else could be do ?  Without Hitler's help, he
didn't even have oil to fuel his fleet.  Besides, the Duce would like to go to
Africa in triumph when the British finally were humiliated and their place
taken by the Italians - and Mussolini himself.
   Rommel's attack at first succeeded as he had expected.  By June 27th he was
at El Alamein, where the British had stopped their retreat and establish a
defensive position.  Alexandria was hardly 60 miles away.  So close - and yet,
as events would soon prove, so very far.
   The Field Marshal did not pause but immediately attempted an attack on the
British positions.  Yet his exhausted forces could not break through.  Then,
on July 3rd, he tried again, throwing everything he could into the attack.
Once again it failed.  Finally, facing the fact that he would have to await
reserves and reinforcements before crossing those crucial 60 miles, Rommel went
on the defensive.
   Rommel called for his reinforcements.  They were sent - among them, airborne
regiments from Sicily, where they had been waiting to take part to the planned
invasion of Malta.  The die had been truly cast; Malta would no longer be
considered to have priority.  Rommel's operations must take precedence.
   Meanwhile, Malta had been having a change of fortune also.  Knocked to her
knees in the terrible six weeks of air bombardment in April and May, she had
begun to recover even while the bombardment was on.  The day before its formal
lifting on May 10, 60 Spitfires had been flown in to Malta from the decks of
the British carrier EAGLE and the American WASP.  Other planes had been flown
in by the same method earlier, but the island had not been well prepared to
receive them and many had been destroyed on the ground.
   This time the islanders were ready.  Some of the planes were in the air
within 35 minutes after landing, taking part in the defense against the bombing
raid in progress.  (The result was 12 attacking German planes lost for only 3
spitfires.)  No longer could German planes fly in at will and make the citizens
suffer with no hope of making the attackers pay.  More Spitfires were coming
in all the time.  And when, in July, the Axis decided that the bombing of Malta
must be resumed, that island was already sufficiently every bomb he dropped.
The July "suppression" turned out to be a flop.
   But there were other problems on Malta.  It could not be restored as an
offensive base until it could be supplied more regularly.  After devastating
losses in the early spring, the British had decided to call off further supply
convoys until they could be better protected from the air.  Yet supplies were
so low that something had to be done if the island was not to surrender.  It
was decided, therefore, to make a desperate double attempt to run the gauntlet
again - from both ends of the Mediterranean at the same time.
   The plan was in send from Alexandria a convoy of ten supply ships, escorted
by seven cruisers and almost three times that many destroyers (as noted above,
there were no longer any serviceable battleships or carriers left in the
Alexandria fleet).  At the same time a convoy, including six supply ships,
would be sent from Gibraltar.  There would be an escort of cruisers and
destroyers for this group also; furthermore, they would be covered by Force H,
a group of heavier ships which would include two carriers and a battleship.
   The Italians placed priority on destroying the convoy from Alexandria.  Thus
they dispatched two battleships, four cruisers and three whole divisions of
destroyers to attack it; in addition, they concentrated heavy air attacks
against it.  Ninety planes attacked it on June 14, sinking one supply ship and
damaging another.  On the 15th the losses began to pile up.  One cruiser was
sunk by a motor torpedo boat, and a destroyer went down from a submarine's
torpedo.  Shortly after, a second cruiser was hit and damaged.  At this point
the commander learned of the heavy Italian surface fleet ahead of him.  He
quickly pulled back and asked for air attacks to even the unbalanced odds
against his force.  Although a battleship was hit and damaged in these attacks,
it was able to proceed in the action against the convoy.  One cruiser was
damaged enough to be taken out of the action and was later sunk by a submarine.
Yet Axis planes returned to renew their attack and two British destroyers were
sunk.  Warship losses were piling up, anti-aircraft ammunition was running low,
and the large Italian surface fleet had not yet been encountered.  The convoy
commander decided he would have to cut his losses and return to Alexandria.
Thus, not one supply ship from this convoy made it through to the nearly
starving Malta.
   The convoy coming from the west was also having heavy slogging.  Air attacks
on the 13th and 14th had been nearly continuous, but only one cruiser had been
forced to drop out to return for repairs.  On the evening of the 15th the
heavier ships of Force H turned back to Gibraltar as they were accustomed to do
when reaching the narrow waters between Sicily and Tunisia.  The convoy would
have to run the rest of the way with only one light cruiser and nine destroyers
as escort and yet they had to face another Italian surface fleet - smaller than
the one sent east, but still much superior to the small British force.
   On the morning of the 15th, the Italian ships made contact and immediately
attacked.  The British warships gamely advanced to meet the threat, sending the
vulnerable supply ships away to the southwest.  The action between the surface
warships was almost foreordained.  One British destroyer was sunk and another
damaged before they could turn away.  Nevertheless, the supply ships had been
temporarily saved.  They were soon to be attacked by aircraft, however, and
three more of the cargo ships went down.
   What was left of the convoy finally arrived at Malta after dark - but there
was more loss to come.  Running into a minefield, one destroyer was sunk and
two more, along with a minesweeper and a supply ship were damaged.
   The end result of all these losses from two separate convoys, therefore, was
the arrival in Malta of only two supply ships.  Nevertheless, so great was the
need for supplies on Malta that even this slight success was significant.  For
it enabled the island to stretch out for a few more weeks the day on which it
would be forced to surrender, if more supplies could not be obtained.  So as
it turned out, this "Italian victory" was, in a strategic sense, rather a
victory for the British.
   Malta was indeed reviving.  First had come the Spitfires flown in from the
American and British carriers.  By July 12th the channel had been cleared of
mines and submarines were again operating from their old base.  How effective
they were to be was seen by the fact that, during the next month, 34% of the
supplies intended for Rommel were sunk on route.  And it was not long before
surface ships were again using Malta for a base.
   Meanwhile, help that would make a big difference to life on Malta was being
planned.  The long suffering citizens of that island, emerging cautiously from
their bomb shelters deep down in the rock, could not of course be told, but on
July 24th the decision was made by the British and American leaders to invade
North Africa in the west.  When that invasion took place, a whole new situation
would be created, with tremendously increased naval and air forces driving the
dreaded German bombers from the skies.  And the Desert Fox, despite all his
clever stratagems, would be boxed in from front and rear.
   but that was in the unknown future.  For now there were more desperate
problems.  The two ships in June had saved the island and its population.  But
now supplies were again growing very short, and once again the commander of the
island had figured out to the exact day how long he could ask the people to go
on without additional supplies too, and they finally determined to try
again, with a far greater escort than had ever been employed in the
Mediterranean before to run the gauntlet with another supply convoy.  it was
called the "Pedestal Convoy." and it has gone down in naval history as one of
the heroic exploits of British sailors and merchant seamen.
   The Convoy was formed at Gibraltar.  It consisted of eleven cargo ships
escorted by no fewer than four carriers, seven cruisers, and twenty-five
destroyers.  By August 11th they were under attack by Axis forces.  The
submarines were there first, and they took a costly first-blood, sinking the
carrier EAGLE.  Then there followed, in the next two days, wave after wave of
German and Italian planes rushing to the attack.  A second carrier was hit by
three bombs and had to turn back.  At the end of the day of August 12th the
main escort's work was done and it turned back for Gibraltar as the cargo ships
entered the narrow waters between Sicily and Tunisia.  They were now shepherded
by a mere three cruisers and ten destroyers.  That night Axis submarines
surfaced and sank the cruiser CAIRO and four cargo ships.  Then motor torpedo
boats joined the attack and sank a tanker and more cargo ships.
   The next morning more planes appeared.  But by evening two cargo ships had
made it through to Malta.  Later there arrived another cargo ship and one
priceless oil-laden tanker, the OHIO, heavily damaged and given up for lost
time and time again.  but always the desperately working, exhausted sailors
returned to attack new low lines, moving ships alongside to keep the tanker
afloat, dragging, pushing, and almost literally holding up the badly damaged
ship until it was safe in harbor.  It had been a very costly operation for the
British navy.  But Malta, whose commander had already picked his "surrender
day" if supplies did not appear, could relax for a moment of satisfaction.  The
bitterly fought over remnant of the convoy had arrived just four days before
the commander's "surrender day."  There were now supplies and fuel enough to
last until the Mediterranean could once again become a British sea.
   And now Rommel, realizing that his Fuehrer had placed all the stakes on the
invincible Desert Fox and his promise to push through to Alexandria and beyond,
perhaps feeling the first twinges of doubt that he could carry out his
prediction, made a last desperate effort.  On the night of August 30-31,
despite his complaints that no longer were sufficient reinforcements and
supplies getting through to him, he attacked the left, center, and right of the
British line at El Alamein.  It was the usual Rommel attack, with the 15th and
21st Panzer and 90th Light Divisions trying to make an end run around the left
of the British while the other forces made feints or holding attacks.
Montgomery, now in command of the British Eighth Army, had purposely refused
his left flank, drawing it back into an "L" shape.  Thus, when Rommel moved in
and turned north to come in behind the British forces, he was opposed by an
impassable line of anti-tank fire, aided by close support air attacks.  The
Desert Fox was out of tricks, low on supplies, and before long would be out of
Africa.
   For when Montgomery was ready to attack in October, his army had been
supplied far beyond anything it had had in the past.  Supplies and
reinforcements had been coming in a solid stream around the Cape of Good Hope
and up the Suez Canal, while Rommel's still had to run the gauntlet of British
air and sea power in the Mediterranean - aided and abetted by that piece of
rock, bristling now with offensive weapons, which the Field Marshal had begged
Hitler not to invade, so that the desert attack might proceed.  Montgomery had
150,000 men to Rommel's less than 100,000.  And while the Axis forces had
between 500 and 600 tanks, half of them were Italian, and thus much inferior.
The British had 1114, including nearly 400 Grants and Shermans.
   The battle could be dragged out for some time - even after the American and
British landings in November in northwest Africa.  But with the heavy supplies
pouring in to the Allies, and very little getting through to Rommel's forces,
there could be little doubt how it would end.
   And right there in the middle of the final act, effective again in
preventing supplies from reaching the Field Marshal was that damnable pile of
rock - Malta, now fully recovered well supplied and dangerous as ever.
