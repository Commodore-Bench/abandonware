1.0 INTRODUCTION

WARSHIP is a game of tactical-level naval combat between Japanese and 
Allied ships from 1941 to 1945.

1.1 Description of Action

Each game turn consists of two phases.  In the orders phase, the 
players, one at a time, give orders to the ships that they control.  In 
the action phase all ships will carry out their orders.  During the 
action phase, ship and torpedo movement will be updated every 30 
seconds; searches and gunfire will be resolved every 2 minutes.  Players 
may interrupt the action phase after each 2-minute period to modify 
their orders or check the status of their ships.

1.5 Saving a Game

At the end of the deployment phase and before each orders phase, the 
computer will allow the players to save the game in progress.  You will 
need a scratch disk to store the save game data.

When restarting a saved game, you must set the correct number of players 
on the opening menu.

1.6 The map

The Warship map is a 60 x 60 square grid with each square measuring 1000 
yards across.  Players may elect to fight their battles on an open sea 
map, on a Savo Sound map, or on a custom map that the players design 
themselves.

1.7 Sound

During the action phase, the players may toggle the sound on/off by 
pressing the <S> key.

2.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION

2.2 Abbreviations

Abbreviations used in the game are listed:
	BB	Battleship
	BC	Battlecruiser
	CA	Heavy cruiser
	CL	Light cruiser
	CLAA	Anti-aircraft cruiser
	DD	Destroyer
	DE	Destroyer escort
	AK	Cargo ship

3.0 STARTING THE GAME
	
3.2 Player Determination

Warship may be played by either zero, one or two players, and this is 
determined by the option selected on the opening menu.

3.3 Handicap Level

At the start of the game the players must determing the handicap level 
(1-5).  The effects of the handicap levels are listed below:
	Level 1	Allied strength reduced 20%
	Level 2	Allied strength reduced 10%
	Level 3	No reduction
	Level 4	Japanese strength reduced 10%
	Level 5	Japanese strength reduced 20%

A player’s ‘strength’ is reduced by lowering the number of ship 
selection points that he may use to buy his force.  The handicap does 
not affect play of the historical scenarios.

3.4 Delay length

The delay length affects the messages displayed during the action phase.  
The greater the delay length the longer these messages will remain 
displayed.  A delay length of 1 will greatly speed up the game but will 
cause some messages to be virtually unreadable.  A delay length of 9 
will slow the game considerably, but will allow the player maximum time 
to study the various reports provided during the action phase.  No delay 
will be provided after the display of non-penetrating hits during the 
action phase.

3.5 Selecting a Scenario

You may select one of 4 historical scenarios (see 14.0), or you may 
elect to build your own scenario.  If you select a historical scenario, 
the computer will skip the deployment phase and go directly to the 
orders phase to start the game.

If you elect to build your own scenario, you will be asked several 
questions regarding the time and conditions of battle (see 4.0)

New players are advised to begin by playing scenarios they have created 
themselves.  Creating and playing a small battleline scenario on an open 
sea map is recommended.

4.0 Building Scenarios

When building scenarios the players must answer questions regarding the 
time and conditions of battle.  Players will have the option of 
selecting/buying the ships or allowing the computer to automatically 
select an appropriate force.

4.1 Selecting the Battle Area Map

Players have the option of selecting:
	1. Open Sea
	2. Savo Sound
	3. Custom Map

Open Sea - A 60x60 square grid with no land masses.  When playing 
battleline scenarios on an open sea map, the map will attempt to shipft 
to prevent ships from sailing off the edge.

Savo Sound - A 60x60 map including Savo Island in the center, 
Guadalcanal in the south and Florida Island in the NE.  Five major 
surface actions were fought in this area during the latter months of 
1942.

Custom Map - The player may recall a custom map that he previously 
constructed and stored on a scratch disk (see 15.0)

4.2 Build Scenario or Design Map

Players wishing to design a new map or modify an existing custom map 
should select the D option.  To build a new custom map the player should 
have selected the open sea option in 4.1.  To modify an existing custom 
map the player should have recalled the appropriate custom map in 4.1.  
Instructions for constructing custom maps are described in 15.0.

4.3 Setting the Time and Date of Battle

Players may adjust the time and date of battle by using the following 
menu options:
	Year		from 1941 to 1945
	Month
	Day
	Hour
	Minute
	Accept displayed time/date

The year selected will determine the availability of various ship 
classes and the availability and quality of radar on the ships.  The 
hour selected will determine if day, night, dawn, or dusk visibility 
conditions are in effect.
	Dawn	500 to 559
	Day	600 to 1759
	Dusk	1800 to 1859
	Night	1900 to 459

4.4 Set Game Length

The players may select a game length of either 1 to 4 hours.  It is 
recommended that at least 2 hours be allowed for battles where the 
opposing forces start out of contact.  When the game ends, players may 
elect to continue the game if they so desire.  If a game is continued, 
the computer will stop the game after 30 additional minutes have been 
completed.

4.5 Set Visibility Level (VL)

A visibility level from 1 to 9 may be selected.  A VL of 1 would 
represent poor visibility conditions such as fog while a VL of 9 would 
represent excellent visibility conditions.

The VL is used in conjunction with the time of day to determine the 
range at which ships may sight each other.

4.6 Air Control Over Battle Area

Air control over the battle area may be either Allied, Japanese, or 
Neutral.  If a player has air control then his opponent will score fewer 
points for damaging ships.  In the historical scenarios, the Allied 
player automatically has air superiority.

4.7 Set Damage Control Levels

Damage control abilities must be set for both the Japanese and Allied 
forces.  A number from 1 to 4 must be selected for each player.  The 
higher the number selected the better the players’ ships will be at 
repairing damage and putting out fires.  In the historical scenarios, 
Japanese damage control is always set at 2, while Allied damage control 
is always set at 3.  These are considered to be the historical values.

4.8 Selecting the Type of Action

The players may select from 5 different types of battle:

Japanese Transport - The Japanese players scores points for ‘exiting’ 
cargo loaded ships off the east map edge.  Both players score points for 
damaging or sinking enemy ships.  The Japanese plalyer may designate any 
of his ships to carry cargo but the Allied player scores double points 
for damaging or sinking these ships.

Japanese Bombardment - The Japanese player scores points for exiting 
combat ships off the east map edge.  Both players score points for 
damaging or sinking enemy ships.  Points scored for exiting is 
determined by the size and number of main guns on the ship.

Battleline - Players score points only for damaging or sinking enemy 
ships.

Allied Bombardment - The Allied player scores points for exiting combat 
ships off the west edge of the map.  Both players score points for 
damaging enemy ships.

Allied Transport - The Allied player scores points for exiting cargo 
ships (AK only) off the west edge of the map.  Both players score points 
for damaging or sinking enemy ships.

4.9 Selecting a Large or Small Battle

The number of ship selection points (SSPs) that a player may use to buy 
his force is determined by the type of action and the size (large or 
small) of the battle.  Listed below are SSPs provided for each type of 
battle:
		
					Large			Small
Transport				480/400		240/200
Bombardment				360/320		180/160
Battleline				1200			600

When two numbers divided by a ‘/’ are shown, the first number is the 
number for the player attempting to exit ships and the second number is 
for his opponent.

When selecting small bombardment or transport type actions the players 
may not include battleships or battlecruisers in their forces.

The SSPs shown above are for battles fought at handicap level 3 (see 
3.3).

4.10 Selecting Ships

The Allied player may select from 53 different American, British, and 
Dutch ships.  The Japanese player may select from 27 different ship 
classes.  If the auto-select option is used then the computer will 
select a force to suit the type of battle.  When using auto-select the 
computer will sometimes exceed the SSP limit (this will happen when 
selecting both human and computer forces).

The computer will only allow the selection of ships that were available 
during the year selected as the time of the battle.  The computer will 
decide the radar level for each ship based on the year of the scenario 
and a random factor.  No points are awarded for unused SSPs, so the 
players should find a way to spend them all.  Each player is limited to 
selecting a maximum of 20 ships.

5.0 Deployment Phase

During the deployment phase, the players may alter the starting 
location, speed, and facing of their ships..  Also, utilities may be 
employed to designate ships as ‘transports’, change their starting 
division, rename the ship and even alter the ship’s characteristics 
(such as # of guns, radar, speed, etc.)  The computer will never alter 
its automatically generated deployment, and will never modify a ship.  
When playing a scenario against the computer, you should accept the 
deployment created by the computer.  Players may agree between 
themselves on allowed deployment changes.

If you have created a map, be sure to check the deployment of both 
sides’ forces; otherwise, they may be deployed on land.

5.1 Map Menu

The deployment phase starts with the map menu displayed in the text 
window below the map display.  The following items are included on the 
menu:

(1-8) Move Cursor - By pressing the keys 1-8 the cursor may be moved 
around the map.  The map may scroll if the cursor is moved to the edge 
of the screen display.

			   8	1  2
			    \	| /
			     \|/
		        7---+---3

(A-?) Select Ship - Ships are assigned an ID letter (A,B,C...)  By 
pressing akey that corresponds to an active ship the computer will shift 
to the ship display menu and the selected ships will be displayed.

(U) Change Terrain - Allows the player to change the type of terrain in 
the square covered by the cursor (see 15.0)

(Z) Get Ship - Allows the player to select a friendly ship in the square 
covered by the cursor.  The computer will shift to the ship display 
menu.

(X) Exit - Exits deployment phase.

5.2 Ship Display Menu

Ship status data will be displayed at the top of the ship display menu.  
An example of the ship status data is shown:

E	BB	YAMATO	C:180		S:15		D:2L

	E		ship ID
	BB		ship type
	YAMATO	ship name
	C:180		ship course
	S:15		ship speed
	D:2L		ship division: the ‘L’ means lead ship

Below the ship data the following menu items are listed:

(M)ove - Current ship is moved to cursor location
(L)ook - Cursor is moved to current ship’s location
(C)ourse - Enter desired starting course (0-358). Even #’s only.
(S)peed - Enter starting speed.
(D)ivision - Enter starting division number (1-9)
(T)ransport - Designate current ship for cargo transport. A ‘T’ is 
displayed next to the division number for cargo carrying ships.  Can be 
toggled on/off.
(R)ename - Renames current ship (maximum 14 characters).  Ships start 
the game with their class name.
(W)eapon - Change some or all of the ships’ characteristics (see 16.0)
(N)ext - Searches for next friendly ship.
(X) Exit - Exits ship display menu

6.0 Orders Phase

Players may stop the action phase and enter the orders phase by pressing 
the (O) key.  The computer will shift to the orders phase at the end of 
the current 2 min. action segment.

6.1 Command Modes

There are two different ways to control ships in the game.  In division 
mode the players give general orders to groups of ships. In the ship 
mode the players give specific orders to individual ships.  The players 
may toggle back and forth between the different command modes during the 
orders phase.  The command mode last chosen during the orders phase will 
be active during the action phase.

6.2 Map Menu

At the start of the orders phase the map menu will be displayed in the 
text window at the bottom of the map display.

(1-8) Move Cursor
(A-?) Select Ship - This option is only available in ship mode.  The 
computer will shift to the ship menu for the selected ship.
(V) Division - By pressing the (V) key the player may then enter a 
number (1-9) of an active division.  The computer will shift to the 
division menu for the selected division.
(W) Command Mode - Change to a different command mode.
(X) Exit
(Z) Get Ship - Select friendly ship at cursor location and switch to 
ship menu.  Only available in ship mode.
(0) Score - Show current points score.

6.3 Division Menu

The player may check the current division orders by examining the data 
listed at the bottom of the text window.  An example of the divisional 
orders data is shown:

	HOLD FIRE		C:134		S:25		F:L

HOLD FIRE - All ships in the division have orders to hold their fire.
C:134 - Division has been assigned a course of 134 (southeast)
S:25 - Division’s ships have been assigned a speed of 25 knots.
F:L - Division’s ships have been ordered to assume line formation.

The following menu options may be used to modify the current division 
orders or examine ships:

(H)old Fire - Instructs division to hold its fire.  Ships will not fire 
guns or torpedoes while in effect.
(T)orpedo Fire - Instructs division to fire torpedoes only.  Ships will 
not fire guns while in effect.  Torpedoes will be fired when computer 
judges it wise to do so.
(G)un Fire - Instructs division to fire guns only.  Torpedoes will not 
be fired.
(O)pen Fire - Instructs division to fire both guns and torpedoes.
(S)peed - Change assigned division speed.
(C)ourse - Change assigned division course
(F)ormation - Change division formation to/from line/parallel (see 7.4)
(E)xamine Ships - Examine division’s ships (changes to ship mode) 
starting with division’s lead ship.
(X)Exit

6.4 Ship Menu

Ship status data will be listed at the top of the text window.  An 
example of the data is shown:

A	CA	MYOKO		C:120		S:20/34	D:1L

A		ship has ID letter ‘A’
CA		ship type is ‘CA’
MYOKO		ship name
C:120		ship’s current course (ESE)
S:20/34	ship’s current speed (20 knots) and maximum speed (34 knots)
D:1L		ship is in division 1 and is lead ship

The ship menu contains the following routines:

(W)eapons - By pressing the (W) key the player may view all of the 
ship’s weapons.  A sample weapons display is shown:

CA 	MYOKO

2 x 8/50 GUN		F:BOW			A:120
2 x 8/50 GUN		F:BOW			A:120
2 x 8/50 GUN		F:CENTER		A:120
2 x 8/50 GUN		F:STERN		A:120
2 x 8/50 GUN		F:STERN		A:120
4 X 5/40 GUN		F:LEFT		A:250
4 X 5/40 GUN		F:RIGHT		A:250
8 X TYPE 93 TORPEDO	F:LEFT		A:16
8 X TYPE 93 TORPEDO	F:RIGHT		A:16

ARMOR:	B4	D2	T4/0
RADAR:	0	PROPULSION:	34

In the above example the Myoko has a main armament of 10-8 inch 50 
caliber guns (in 5 double turrets) with 120 rounds of ammo per gun.  The 
secondary armament consists of 8 5 inch, 40 cal guns with 250 rounds per 
gun.  Torpedo armament consists of 16 torpedo tubes with 1 reload per 
tube.

Also listed in the display, the ship’s armor protection consists of 4 
inches of belt armor, 2 inches of deck armor, 4 inches of primary turret 
armor and no secondary turret armor.  The ship has no radar and is 
capable of 34 knots maximum speed.

(D)amage - By pressing the (D) key the player may view the ship’s 
damage.  Flooding damage, electrical damage, and bridge damage is 
expressed as a percentage.  Rudder damage is also a percentage, unless 
it is jammed or detached.  Fires are expressed numerically, with a 
larger number, the greater the fire.  When a ship’s fire control is 
knocked out, the display will display KO.  Any number displayed next to 
the fire control is the radar level of the ship.

(K)Smoke - Pressing the (K) key causes the current ship to ‘make smoke’.  
An ‘S’ will be displayed next to the ship’s division number.  Can be 
toggled on/off.  Only DD’s, DE’s, and Japanese CL’s may make smoke.

(G)Target - Pressing the (G) key views the ship’s current target.  The 
computer will display the type of target being engaged, the target size, 
the range to the target, and whether or not the target is ‘ranged in’ 
(and if so, by what method of fire control).

(C)hange Division - Assigns current ship to any division (1-9).  Only 
used in division mode.

(S)peed - Assigns new speed (only in ship mode)

(C)ourse - Assigns new course or instruct it to ‘follow’ friendly ship 
(ship mode only)

(T)orpedo - Used in ship mode.  The player must determine if a slow or 
fast torpedo setting is used, aim the torpedo mount at a particular 
point on the map and then fire a salvo consisting of some or all of the 
mount’s torpedoes.

(V)isual - Select enemy ship as target using visual fire control (ship 
mode)
(R)adar - Select enemy ship as target using radar fire control (ship 
mode)
(L)ook - Cursor moves to current ship’s location.
(N)ext - Displays next ‘friendly’ ship.
(X)Exit

7.0 Movement

7.1 Movement Rate

Each square on the map is 1000 yards across.  The game is scaled such 
that a ship travelling at 30 knots will enter a new square every minute.  
Shipe moving diagonally will take longer (based on the angle) to move 
one square.

7.2 Changing Speed

When ships are assigned a new speed, their current speed will be 
gradually increased or decreased until it equals the assigned speed.  
The rates of acceleration and deceleration are shown below:

				Acceleration		Deceleration
BB,BC				1 kpm				40% per min
CA,CL,CLAA			2 kpm				55% per min
DD,DE				4 kpm				55% per min

Ships in division mode will always change speed at the BB rate.

7.3 Course and Turning

Ships may travel on any courses with even numbers between 0 and 358.

			315   0   45
			    \	| /
			     \|/
		      270---+---90
			     /|\
			    /	| \
			225  180  135

When ships are assigned a new course, their current course will be 
gradually changed until it equals the assigned course.  The rates that 
ships change course are shown below:

	DD,DE							48 per min
	BB,BC,CA,CL,CLAA					32 per min
	Division Mode					32 per min
(Note: A lead ship in a division in line formation will only be able to 
turn 24 per min if player is in division mode)
	Rudder Damage> 25% or 
	Bridge Damage > 49%				20 per min
	Rudder Detached					12 per min

Undamaged ships in ship mode will use the top two turn rates.  Undamaged 
ships in division mode uses division mode turn rate.  Ships with damaged 
bridge or rudder uses last two turn rates.

7.4 Moving in Formation

In division mode only, ships will move in formation.  Divisions may be 
assigned either line or parallel formation.

In line formation, the lead ship will assume the division’s assigned 
course, the second ship will follow the lead ship, etc.  A ship that is 
more than one square away from the ship which it is following will speed 
up (if possible) and attempt to catch up to the leading ship.  Ships 
within one square of the ship they are following will set their speed to 
match that of the ship they are following.

Ships in division mode will always have their course rounded to the 
nearest 45 degree increment for movement purposes, although the ship 
display will show the unrounded number. e.g. a ship in division mode 
with an ordered course of 200 will actually mov in course 180.  This 
will enable ships to maintain line formations.

In parallel formation, all ships in the division will assume the 
divisions assigned course.

7.5 Running Aground

A ship that moves into a land square will immediately have its 
propulsion reduced to 0.  There are no other effects from running 
aground.

7.6 Collisions

Ships in the same square may collide with one another if at least one 
ship is going at least 10 knots.  Ships travelling on the same course 
will have a greatly reduced change of collision.  Ships will usually not 
collide with the ship they are following.  If a collision occurs, both 
ships will be reduced in speed to less than 10 knots and will suffer 
damage based on the size of the ships and their speed at the moment of 
collision.

8.0 Gunfire

8.1 Selecting Targets for Gunfire

When using division mode, ships will automatically select targets for 
gunfire if their division has been assigned gun fire or open fire 
instructions.

When using ship mode, the players may select targets for individual 
ships by using the visual or radar commands on the ship menu.  Ships 
with a radar rating of zero and ships with their fire control destroyed 
may not use radar target selection.  Ships using the visual routine to 
select their targets will employ visual fire control and use the visual 
gunfire accuracy modifiers.  Ships using the radar routine to select 
targets will employ radar fire control and use the radar gunfire 
accuracy modifiers.

8.2 Gunfire Accuracy

The probability of a gunshot hitting its target is equal to 1/a where a 
represents the ‘inverse gunfire accuracy’ of a particular gunfire.  The 
list of accuracy modifiers used to calculate a are shown below:

	FC	EFFECT	DESCRIPTION
	all	add		target speed/2
	all 	add		target turn*/2
	all	add		firer speed/2
	all	add		firer turn*/2
	V	add		10, if other ships firing at target
	V	add		30, if ranging in
	V	add		20, if visibility<21; add 5 if firing ship is
				Japanese OR
	V	add		30, if visibility<7; add 15 if firing ship is 
				Japanese
	R	add		30, for radar fire control

* - The difference between the ship’s current course and its assigned 
course.  Ships following other ships consider their assigned courses to 
be that which aims them directly at the ship they are following.

After all additions have been made, the following multipliers may be 
applied:

	all x	1/2, if crossing the target ship’s ‘T’
	all x (10-radar)/10, x2 if fire control is KO’d
	all x range/gun max range
	V   x 1/2, if ranged in

After all multipliers have been applied:

	all	add 5
	all	add 5, if CA, CL, CLAA, AK target
	all 	add 25, if DD,DE target

V -- Visual fire control only
R -- Radar fire control only

Example:  The Fuso without radar is visually ranging in on the New 
Mexico at a range of 30,000 yards.  Both ships are travelling at their 
maximum speeds, and neither ship is turning.  The New Mexico is not 
being fired upon by any other ship.  The visibility is 30; therefore the 
change to hit it 1/46:

a = (( 24/2 + 22/2 +30)*30/38)+5=46	

If the Fuso is successful in ranging in, it will have a 1/14 change on 
its next attempt:

a = (( 24/2 + 22/2 )*30/38*1/2)+5=14

Note that round off errors of +-1 may occur.

The probability of a gunshot hitting will never be worse than 1/230.

8.3 Ranging In

Ships using visual fire control must spend at least 1 turn of ‘ranging 
in’ fire before firing for full effect..  Ships succeed in ranging in if 
accuracy a x RND < 50.  During a ranging fire turn, ships will only fire 
1 shot per gun.  Ships using radar fire control are never required to 
range in.

8.4 Ammo Use

The number of shells fired per gun is equal to 1+ammo/50.  The ammo 
number shown on the weapons display represents the number of rounds 
remaining for each gun.  Ships ranging in on a target will fire only 1 
shot per gun.

8.5 Gun Hit Location and Armor Penetration

When a ship is hit by gunfire the computer will randomly determine the 
section of the ship that was hit and calculate the change of the shell 
penetrating the armor.  Possible hit locations are:

	Near Miss	
	Belt Hit
	Deck Hit
	Superstructure Hit (side or top)
	Primary Turret Hit (side or top)
	Secondary Turret Hit (side or top)
	Tertiary Turret Hit
	Torpedo Mount Hit

Shell hits that penetrate a ship’s armor can cause significant damage to 
the ship.  To determine if a shell penetrates, the gun’s adjusted 
penetration rating (APR) must be compared to the armor protecting the 
hit location.  If the APR is greater than the ship’s armor, the hit 
automatically penetrates.  If the APR is equal to the ship’s armor, the 
hit has a 50% chance of penetrating.  A ship’s armor is listed on the 
weapons display section of the ship menu.  Superstructure side armor is 
the same as belt armor.  Superstructure top armor, is the same as deck 
armor.  Turret top armor is equal to 1/3 or the turret side armor 
listed.  Tertiary turrets and torpedo mounds are unarmored.  Possible 
damage caused by a near miss is determined by comparing the shell size 
(not penetration) to the belt armor.

Two APRs are calculated for each gunfire, horizontal and vertical 
penetration.  Vertical penetration is used against deck, superstructure 
top and turret top armor.  Horizontal penetration is used against all 
other armor.

	P - Gun penetration rating
	R - Range to target
	M - Gun maximum range

vertical penetration = 1 + (PxR)/(Mx4)
horizontal penetration = 1+((1+M-R)xP)/(Mx2)+P/2-(PxR)/(Mx4)

Example: Using the example in section 8.2, the Fuso would be firing with 
a vertical penetration of 5 and a horizontal penetration of 10.

Vertical penetration may be reduced for certain shell sizes:

	6 inch		x 2/3
	3-5.5 inch		x 1/3

8.6 Weapon Facing

Weapons (both guns and torpedoes) on a ship may have 5 possible facings:

	Bow - Center - Left - Right - Stern

Weapons with the wrong facing relative to the target will be unable to 
fire at that target.  A facing diagram is shown below

				\  B   /
				 \    /
				  \  / 
			     L   OO   R
				  /  \
                         /    \
                        /  S   \

The above diagram represents the field of fire of a ship travelling on 
course 0.  The field is divided into four 90 degree arcs labelled 
B,L,R,S.

- Bow faced guns may not fire at targets in the S arc
- Center faced guns may not fire at targets in the B or S arcs
- Left faced guns may only fire at targets in the L arc
- Right faced guns may only fire at target in the R arc
- Stern faced guns may not fire at targets in the B arc

8.7 Secondary Targets

In many situations a ship has certain gun mounts that are unable to 
‘face’ the ship’s primary target.  In these situations the gun mount 
will fire at the nearest visible enemy ship that it can face.  Secondary 
and tertiary gun mounts, such as 5 inch guns on battleships and 
cruisers, will always fire at the nearest visible enemy ship that can be

The gun description consists of two numbers: gun barrel size in inches / 
gun caliber.  Numbers listed in the size column represent the weight of 
the shell.  Numbers listed in the range column reflect the range of the 
gun in 1000s of yards.  Numbers listed in the pen column reflect the 
armour penetration effectiveness of the gun.

8.10 Combat Gunfire Display

When one ship fires its guns at another ship during the action phase, a 
message such as the one below will be displayed

	BB UNDER FIRE FROM 16/50 GUNS
	ACCURACY: 1/38	PEN 	22 3
	BELT HIT*
	PRIMARY TURRET HIT

In this example, a battleship is being fired at by a turret of 16/50 
guns, with each shell fired having a 1 in 38 chance of hitting.  The 
shells have a horizontal penetration capability of 22 and a vertical 
penetration capability of 3.  The firing ship has scored two hits, the 
first penetrating the belt armour (a * indicates penetration; a second * 
indicates flotation damage), the second bouncing off the armour of a 
primary turret.  There will be no delay after the display of a non-
penetrating hit.

9.0 Torpedoes

9.1 Torpedo Salvoes

Torpedoes are fired in salvoes of 1 or more torpedoes.  All torpedoes in 
a salvo move together.  When a salvo enters a square occupied by a ship, 
each torpedo will have a change of hitting the ship.

9.2 Torpedo Intercept Angle

The torpedo intercept angle (ia) is important in determining the chance 
of torpedoes hitting the ship.  The ia is calculated by comparing the 
torpedoes’ course to that of the ship they are attacking.

ia = abs(torp course - ship course)

If ia>180 then ia=ia-180
if ia>90  then ia=180-ia

Example: Torpedo course=300 Ship course=20
	abs(300-20)=280
	280>180 so: 280-180=100
	100>90  so: 180-100=80
	ia=80

9.3 Torpedo Hit Probability

Each torpedo in a salvo will have a chance of hitting a ship in the same 
square.  The chance of a torpedo hit is calculated using the ia, ship 
evasion capability and torpedo speed:

Ship Evasion (EV) = 225 for DD & DE, 135 for all others
If ship speed <10 then EV=EVxspeed/10
hit% = torp speed x (ia+5)/EV

The hit% formula above shows that the larger the ia, the better the 
chance of a torpedo hit.  For any ship travelling at a speed greater 
than 4 knots there will be a 50% that the ship will make an evasive turn 
to reduce the ia.  After the evasive turn the ia will be reduced by a 
number equal to 1/2 the ship’s turn rate (see 7.3).

9.4 Dud Torpedoes

Torpedoes that hit a ship and explode will cause significant damage to 
the ship.  Ten percent of all torpedoes will be duds that do not explode 
(the MK-15 torpedo will have a 50% dud rate during 1941-42). Dud 
torpedoes will cause no damage.

9.5 Torpedo Symbols

For solitaire games, only the human-fired torpedoes will be visible but 
the computer-fired torpedoes will not.

9.6 Torpedo Data

There are 5 different types of torpedoes included in the game.  Torpedo 
ratings are listed below:

	ID	Description		Size		Speed		Range
	1	MK-IX			9		35/40		14/10
	2	MK-15			8		25/40		14/6
	3	MK-VII		9		33/38		16/11
	4 	Type 6		10		25/35		16/8
	5	Type 93		20		35/50		45/22

The numbers listed in the size column represent the size of the torpedo 
warhead.  There are two numbers listed for both the speed and range of 
the torpedo.  The first number is the speed or range of the torpedo at 
the ‘slow setting’ and the second number is the speed/range at the ‘fast 
setting’.

9.7 Torpedo Reloads

Most Japanese ships carry reloads for their torpedo mouonts.  After 
these ships fire their torpedoes the reload procedure will begin 
automatically.  Reloading torpedo mounts will normally take 30 minutes; 
however, it may be delayed in certain situations.  Ships moving at 
greater than 21 knots will temporarily suspend the reloading until the 
speed can be reduced.

9.8 Torpedo Combat Displays

Whenever a torpedo enters a square occupied by an enemy ship, a message 
will be displayed stating the class of the ship being attacked, the 
course of the torpedoes, and any hits scored by the torpedoes.  The 
display will also state any dud torpedo hits.

10.0 Searching

Every two minutes of game time, ships will perform both radar and visual 
searches to locate and target enemy ships.

10.1 Search Procedure

The search segment occurs at the end of each two minutes of the action 
phase.  At the start of the search segment all ships will become 
‘unsighted’.  During the search segment each ship may search and sight 
any enemy ship within detection range.

10.2 Visual Search

To determine if any enemy ship (target) is within visual detection 
range, the following formula is used:

	V = Visibility
	R = Range to Target
	SS = Searcher Size (flotation)
	TS = Target Size (flotation)
	TF = Target Fire Level
	DR = Detection range

Night Detection (V < 21):

	DR = V + TF
		+5 if target is firing
		+5 if target is under fire

To calculate visibility when V<21, multiply V by 0.75 for Allied ships 
conducting visual search.

Day Detection (V > 20):

	DR = 10 + V/2 + SS/20 + TS/20 + TF
		+5 if target is under fire

If DR >= R then target is sighted.

10.3 Radar Search

Only ships with a radar rating greater than zero may perform a radar 
search.  The formula for radar detection is shown below:

	RR = Radar Rating

Radar Detection

	DR = 10 + RR x 10
	if DR >=R then detection except if
	R > DR/2 and TS<R then no detection

10.4 Smoke

A ship cannot see through a square in which another ship is making 
smoke.  However, ships can see into and can see out of a square 
containing a ship making smoke.  And ships may always use radar to see 
and fire through smoke.

10.5 Land

Ships may not see through full land (terrain type N; see 15.2) squares 
(visually or with radar), but they  may see through partial land squares 
(terrain types B-M).

11.0 Damage

Ships may be damaged when hit by torpedoes or gunfire.  Ships may 
receive additional damage from uncontrolled fires and flooding.  All 
damage is cumulative.

11.1 Torpedo Damage

When a torpedo explodes against a ship, the following types of damage 
may be expected:

flood% = (1+warheadxrnd)/flotation
	    fire + 4xrnd

In addition, the following types of damage are probable:

50% chance		propulsion - 5 knots
30% chance		propulsion - 10 knots
20% chance		rudder damage = 25 + 75 x rnd
20% chance		above damage doubled
4%  chance		above damage tripled

11.2 Gunfire Damage

The types of damage caused by gunfire will vary with the location and 
armour penetration.  Shots that fail to penetrate the armour will have a 
chance of adding 1 to the fire level; this chance is equal to the shell 
size divided by 40 (i.e. an 8/55 shell will have a 6/40 or 15% chance of 
adding one to the fire level), but will cause no other damage.

S - Shell size
R - Random number between 0 and 1
F - Target flotation

Near Miss

If S x R < Belt armour then no effect otherwise flood%= 3 x R / F

Belt Hit

60%	Flood% = 1 + R x S / 2 x F
 5%	Flood% = 1 + R x S / F and propulsion - 5 knots
15%	Propulsion - 5 knots
 5% 	Rudder damage = 25 + S x R
13%	Fire + 1
 2%  	Magazine Explodes

Deck Hit

15%	Flood% = 1 + R x S / 2 x F
10%	Flood% = 1 + R x S / F and propulsion - 5 knots
 5%	Rudder damage = 25 + S x R
20%	Propulsion - 5 knots
46%	Fire + 1
 4%	Magazine Explodes

Superstructure Hit

15%	Bridge Damage = 25 + 5 x S x R
15%	FC/Radar KO’d
 5%	Electric Damage = 10 x S x R
65%	Fire + 1

Turret Hit

99%	Turret KO’d
 1%	Magazine Explodes

11.3 Fire Damage

Uncontrolled fires on a ship may cause damage to ship systems.  
Additional damage ay occur on a burning ship every two minutes if rnd x 
20 < fire level.

20%	Weapon KO’d
50%	Fire + 1
15%	Propulsion - 5 knots
 5%	Bridge Damage + 10
 5%	FC/Radar KO’d
 4%	Electric Damage + 25
 1%	Magazine Explodes

11.4 Flood Damage

Ships with uncontrolled flooding may suffer additional damage to ship 
systems.

If flood% > 25 and rnd x 10 < 2 then additional flood% damage = 
	1 / flotation = 2

If flood% > 50 then additional electric damage = 25 x rnd

11.5 Repairs

At the start of each two minute segment, a ship’s damage control parties 
will  have a chance to repair damage.  The ability to repair damage will 
be affected by the damage control rating (DC) assigned when building the 
scenario.

Repairs

5%	Flood% -1 / flotation x 2
15%	Fire - 1
5%	Electric damage - 10
5%	Bridge damage - 10
3%	Jammed rudder detached
3%	Rudder damage - 25

The chances of repair listed above will be multiplied by the player’s DC 
rating.  Thus a player with a DC rating of 3 will have a 45% chance of 
reducing the fire level on his ships every 2 minutes.

12.0 Damage Effects

A ship’s damage will reduce its combat effectiveness and, in the case of 
severe flooding, cause it to sink.

12.1 Fire Effects

Uncontrolled fires burning on a ship may cause additional damage to ship 
systems (see 11.3)

12.2 Flooding Effects

Heavy flooding may cause additional damage to ship systems (see 11.4).  
At the start of each 2 minute segment, a ship with 100% flood damage 
will have a 10% chance of sinking (the ship will automatically sink if 
the fire level is greater than two times the ship’s flotation rating).  
Flooding will proportionally reduce a ship’s maximum speed.  For example 
a ship with propulsion of 30 knots and 50% flood damage will have a 
maximum speed of only 15 knots.  If the flood damage is repaired then 
the maximum speed will increase towards the propulsion rating.

12.3 Electric Damage

Damage to a ship’s electric system will affect its ability to fire its 
weapons or use radar.  Ships with greater than 49% electric damage will 
be unable to fire guns or torpedoes, or use radar.  Ships with less than 
50% damage will randomly use or lose electric power during each 2 minute 
segment.  For example, a ship with 25% electric damage will have a 50% 
chance of losing electric power during each 2 minute segment (damage x 2 
equals chance of failure).

12.4 Bridge Damage

Ships with bridge damage greater than 49% will have their ability to 
maneuver impaired (see 7.3)

12.5 Rudder Damage

Ships with rudder damage between 26% and 49% and ships with their rudder 
‘detached’ (DT) will have their ability to maneuver impaired (see 7.3).  
Ships with rudder damage greater than 49% will have their rudder 
‘jammed’ in a particular direction, either left (JL), right (JR), or 
straight ahead (JS).  Ships with a jammed rudder must move or turn in 
the direction the rudder is jammed.  During the repair segment a jammed 
rudder may be either repaired, detached, or jammed in a different 
direction.

12.6 Fire Control and Radar Damage

When a ship’s fire control is KO’d its radar will also be KO’d.  Ships 
with fire control KO’d will have their gunfire accuracy halved.  Fire 
control and radar may not be repaired during the game.

12.7 Propulsion Loss

Propulsion loss represents a reduction in a ship’s maximum speed.  
Propulsion systems may never be repaired during the game.

12.8 Magazine Explosion

Magazine explosions in the game are usually fatal.  100% flooding and 
100 fire levels are added by a magazine explosion.

12.9 Weapons Mount KO’d

Weapon mounts (gun or torpedo) KO’d may not be repaired during the game.  
When a torpedo mount is destroyed, its ammo will be set to 0.

13.0 Scoring

Points may be scored for damaging or sinking enemy ships and sometimes 
for exiting ships off a particular map edge.

13.1 Points for Ships Sunk

Points scored for sinking enemy ships is equal to the ship selection 
points (SSPs) required to buy the ship.  Points will be doubled for 
sinking ships designated for cargo transport.

13.2 Points for Ships Damaged

Points scored for damaging enemy ships varies with the level of damage 
and the SSP value of the ship.

F = Flotation
d% = Damage level
P = Propulsion

d% = FIRE / F + flood%
	If rudder jammed or detached then d% + F / 4
	If P < 15 then d% + (F/2) x (15-P) / 15
	If d% > 0.9 then d% = 0.9

Points scored = d% x SSP
If damaged ship has air cover then Points x 5/9
If damaged ship is designated for cargo transport then Points x 2

13.3 Points Scored for Transport

In transport scenarios the attacking player scores points for exiting 
designated transport ships off a particular map edge.  The Japanese 
player must exit his transports off the east map edge to score points.  
The Allied player must exit his transports off the west edge to score 
points.  The points scored vary with the type of ship exited:

	AK		50
	BB,CA,CL	10 (Japanese only)
	DD		 5 (Japanese only)

No points are scored if the transport has a fire level greater than 4.

13.4 Points Scored for Bombardment

In bombardment scenarios the attacking player scores points for exiting 
combat ships off a particular map edge.  The number of points scored 
varies with the number and size of the ship’s main guns.

	BB, BC		8 per main gun
	CA			4 per main gun
	CL			2 per main gun
	CLAA,DD,DE		1 per gun

The Japanese player may only score points for exiting ships off the east 
map edge.  The Allied player may only score points for exiting ships off 
the west map edge.

13.5 Victory conditions

The player scoring the most points is considered the victor.  In 
bombardment scenarios, the bombarding player must score at least twice 
the number of points as the defending player in order to win (if he does 
not, the defending player is victor).

14.0 Scenarios
	
14.1 Guadalcanal I (13 Nov 1942)

This is a Japanese bombardment scenario with a 1 hour game length.  The 
Japanese SSP total is 449, while the US SSP total is 268.  An American 
force of 8 destroyers and 5 cruisers engaged a Japanese force of 2 
battleships, 1 light cruiser and 11 destroyers.  The Allies lost 2 light 
cruisers and 4 destroyers while the Japanese lost 1 battleship and 2 
destroyers.

14.2 Guadalcanal II (14 Nov 1942)

This is a Japanese bombardment scenario with a 2 hour time length.  The 
Japanese SSP total is 428, while the US SSP total is 442.  This was one 
of only 2 WWII Pacific engagements between opposing battleships.  Two 
American battleships and 4 destroyers fought 1 Japanese battleship, 2 
heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and 11 destroyers.  Two American 
destroyers, 1 Japanese battleship and 1 Japanese destroyer were sunk.

14.3 Empress Augusta Bay (2 Nov 1943)

This is a Japanese bombardment scenario with a 2 hour game length.  The 
Japanese SSP total is 251, while the US SSP total is 288.  An American 
force of 4 new radar-equipped CL’s and 8 DD’s turned back a Japanese 
bombardment group consisting of 2 CA’s, 2 CL’s and 6 DD’s.  One Japanese 
light cruiser and one destroyer were sunk.

14.4 San Bernardino (25 Oct 1944)

This is a battleline scenario with a 2 hour game length.  The Japanese 
Ssp total is 1150, while the US SSP is 1514.  This is a hypothetical 
engagement between battlelines during the Leyte invasion.

15.0 Designing Custom Maps

If the (D)esign Map option is selected (see 4.2) then the may build 
routine may be used to create a custom map.

15.1 Map Build Menu

The following menu options may be used to examine the map and change 
terrain:

(1-8) Move Cursor
(A-N) Set Terrain - Each letter, A-N, represents a different terrain 
symbol which replaces the current terrain at the cursor location.
(U) Auto Shift - When autoshift is activated then the cursor location 
will shift 1 square in the selected direction (1-8) after each set 
terrain key has been pressed.  This function is useful in reducing the 
number of key strokes required to create a new map.
(X) Exit - Computer exits map build routing and enters save to disk 
routine.

15.2 Terrain Types

(Just a general description)

A - 0pen		 	B - Land left w/reef	C - Land bottom w/reef
D - Land top w/reef	E - Land right w/reef	F - Land top rt w/reef
G - Land bottom rt “	H - Land bottom lf “	I - Land top lf   “
J - Land top		K - Land right		L - Land bottom
M - Land left		N - Solid land

16.0 Modifying Ship Data

Players may create custom ships by modifying some or all ship data.

16.1 Modifying Weapons Data

Ships have a maximum of 10 weapon mounts.  Main guns are always listed 
1st, followed by secondary and tertiary weapon. Secondary and tertiary 
turrets that have the same facing may be grouped together on one 
‘mount’.  The number of guns/tubes per turret must be designated to 
determine how many guns/tubed are destroyed when a turret is KO’d.  The 
number of guns/tubes must be evenly divided by the gun/tubes per turret 
or the guns/tubes per turret will automatically be set to 1.

When changing weapon mounts, the following data elements may be altered:

Weapon Type - Use ID numbers listed in 8.8 and 9.6 (0 - no weapon)
Number Guns/Tubes
Facing (1-5) - See 8.6
Ammo/Torpedoes
Main, Secondary or tertiary mount
Guns/Tubes per Turret - Does not apply to main gun turrets

16.2 Modifying Non-Weapons Data

The following non-weapons data elements may be altered:

Maximum Speed
Flotation - Equals 1 + Ship Displacement / 500 (tons)
Radar (0-4)
Belt Armour (Inches)
Deck Armour
Main Turret Armour
Secondary Turret Armour - Tertiary turrets are always unarmoured.
Ship Selection Points - Used for scoring
