1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
On December 16, 1944 the Germans launched their final offensive in the West.
Hitler planned to cross the Meuse River through the Ardennes Forest and reach
Antwerp, isolating several Allied division.  The result could have very well
ended in regional peace favoring the Axis    offensive became known as the
Battle of the Bulge.  BREAKTHROUGH IN THE ARDENNES is a regimental level
simulation of Germany's last effort on the western front.

1.1 Description of Action
-------------------------
Each game turn represents a full day of operations.  These operations include
supply, air strikes, allocating corps artillery, building-up and breaking down
regiments and divisions, constructing and destroying bridges, fortifying,
changing modes, moving units and allocating and resolving combat.

1.2 Talking to the Computer
---------------------------
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers (such as the
number of artillery points) type in the number into the computer and press the
<RETURN> key.  To select a routine from a menu or answer a Yes/No question just
press the desired key.

1.3 Saving a Game
-----------------
At the end of the Reinforcement Phase and every phase thereafter the computer
will allow the player(s) to save the game in progress.  You will need a scratch
disk to store the saved game data.  Save game disks for the Apple must be
initialized for SSI use during a game by following instructions included in the
game program.  Atari and Commodore 64 users may use any disk that has been
properly formatted for use on their computer.  Once a game is saved you will be
able to restart it at the point where you left off.

1.4 Game Scale and Map
----------------------
The game begins December 16, 1944 and ends December 27, 1944 for a total of
twelve turns.  Units in the game range from battalions to divisions.
   The map includes parts of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany super-
imposed on a 32 by 31 hexagon grid.  Each hexagon contains a specific terrain
type (clear, rough, forest, and town) and represents an area of about two miles
,  Hexagons with a small white dot in the middle show German Ownership.
American ownership is shown by a hexagon with no white dot.  Ownership changes
when a unit moves into an enemy hexagon (very important for supply).  Rivers
are represented by blue hexsides.  Hexagons connected by a road have white
hexsides in common (brown on C64).
   The lower portion of the battle south of the Clerf and east of the Alzette
River is not depicted in the game.  Units of both sides that fought in that
general area are not included.  As a result of this detection and also to allow
ample room for American reinforcements to deploy on the southern edge.  German
units are not allowed to enter the zero hexrow of the x coordinate.  Also, not
depicted on the map is the portion of the battlefield west of Rochefort (the
tip of the bulge).  This area is represented in the game by allowing units to
exit the northern portion of the west map edge.
   The map is oriented to the German view of the battle which means that the
top of the screen is west, the right is north, the left is south and the east
is at the bottom.  German units start at the bottom of the screen and fight
their way to the top of the screen.  If you have a difficult time envisioning
this please refer to the map provided.

1.5 Units
---------
The various units depicted in the game are represented graphically, by standard
military symbols for type and size (see Unit Symbol Legend at back of rules
book).  Units are given a number of characteristics, unit and parent unit
designations, combat strength, efficiency, fortification level, supply status,
mode, artillery support content, stacking value, and remaining operation points
.  Units are either module or non-module (see Order of Battle Chart).  Module
units are those such as tank or mechanized infantry that have transportation
organic or inherent to the unit.  Non-module units have little or no such
transportation and must rely on truck pools or travel by foot.
   The standard unit of the game is the regiment/combat command.  These
regiments may build up into divisional units which in turn may breakdown into
component regiments.  Various armored support battalions and independent
brigades have also been included.  Abbreviations used in unit designations are
listed below:

     PZ - Panzer
   PZGR - Panzergrenadier
    RCN - Reconnaissance
    ENG - Engineer
     VG - Volksgrenadier
    ARM - Armored
    CAV - Cavalry
    INF - Infantry
     AB - Airborne
    DIV - Division
    REG - Regiment
   BRIG - Brigade
   BATT - Battalion
     TD - Tank Destroyer
     FB - Fuehrer Begleit
      G - Glider

1.6 Starting the Game (Commodore 64)
------------------------------------
To begin the game, insert the game disk and type LOAD "*",8 and press <RETURN>.
When READY appears type RUN and press <RETURN>.

1.7 Starting the Game (Atari)
-----------------------------
Remove all cartridges from your computer.  To begin the game, boot up the
Scenario side of the disk (800XL owners will have to hold down the OPTION key
when they turn on their computer to boot the game).  After selecting the
starting values for your game, you will be told to insert the Game Side of your
disk.

1.8 Starting the Game (Apple)
-----------------------------
To begin the game, boot your game disk and the game will start automatically.
If you are using an Apple II with Pascal you must first use your BASICS disk.
If you are using an Apple III you just first go into Apple II emulation mode.
If you are using the Apple IIe, keep the CAPS LOCK key pressed down throughout
the game.

1.9 Parts Inventory
-------------------
Your game should contain the following parts:

a. Game box
b. Rule book
c. One 5-1/4" game disk
d. Two map cards

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
====================
BREAKTHROUGH IN THE ARDENNES is a two-sided game.  German vs American.  The
German forces must be commanded by the human player.  The American forces may
be commanded by either a human or the computer.

2.1 Determining Conditions of Play
----------------------------------
At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under
which the game will be played from the menu below:

1. NEW GAME            SAVED GAME
2. LEVEL O PLAY           1 2 3 4
3. HISTORICAL      NON-HISTORICAL
4. SOLITAIRE           TWO PLAYER
5. COLOR      BLACK/WHITE (ATARI)
6. Scenarios
     First Seven Days (16th-22nd)
     Last Seven Days (21st-27th)
     Twelve Days (16th-27th)

If you choose a saved game all options will be pre-determined by that saved
game.
   The level of play represents handicaps given to the German forces.  Level
four is the easiest level and level one is the hardest.  Level three is the
historical level.  At level four the German player is given one more air point
when due air points, double the normal replacement rate, and 50% more artillery
points.  At level three no modifications are made to either side.  At level two
the American player receives 25% more artillery points, double the amount of
replacements, and two additional air points.  At level one the American
receives 50% more artillery points, triple the amount of replacements, and four
additional air points.
   The historical/non-historical option allows the player(s) to experience the
special command control problem the Americans had that prevented them from
blocking the advance of the 116th and 2nd Panzer divisions to Houffalize and
across the Ourthe River early in the battle.  Hexrows 13 through 17 may be
entered only by selected American units (see Order of Battle).
   The color option (Atari only.) gives the German player blue units and the
black/white option gives him white units.
   Three scenarios have been provided to allow players in experience the first
or second half of the battle as well as the full twelve days.  Except for the
Last Seven Days scenario the game begins with the Supply Phase at the beginning
of the turn.

2.2 Historical Set-Up
---------------------
At the start of the game the computer will assign all combat forces in their
locations, depending on the scenario, when the Germans launched their
offensive.

2.3 Sequence of Play
--------------------
1. Air Phase
2. Supply Phase
3. Reinforcement Phase
4. Unit Organization Phase
5. American 1st Operation Phase
6. American 1st Combat Phase
7. German 1st Operation Phase
8. German 1st Combat Phase
9. American 2nd Operation Phase
10. American 2nd Combat Phase
11. German 2nd Operation Phase
12. German 2nd Combat Phase

2.4 Sequence of Play Exceptions
-------------------------------
The first turn (December 16), the Americans have no unit Organization Phase.
Only a few American units are given operation points.  The Germans on December
16th (the first turn) may not move during the 1st phase they may perform any
other action (including allocating combat).  Some German units are given zero
operation points and some receive decreased operation point allowances.  On
December 17th (turn two) some American units have their operation points
reduced.
   The Americans are automatically supplied on December 16th and 17th (turns
one and two).  The Germans are supplied through December 18th (turn three).

3.0 AIR PHASE
=============
During this phase, players will allocate and execute ground attack and
interdiction air missions.

3.1 Air Point Schedule
----------------------
The American player receives air points according to the weather:

     Clear - six points
       Fog - two points
  Overcast - zero points

The German player receives two air points on December 18th (turn three) and
receives the air point every turn with Fog weather.

3.2 Air Mission Menu
--------------------
Either or both players receive air points a menu will appear with the following
commands available:

  (0-6): 0, centers the screen, 1-6: moves
  the cursor in the indicated direction.

  (Q)uit: Exits the menu.

  (I)nterdiction: Adds an air point to interdiction of enemy movement.

  (G)round Attack: Executes an attack on the hex beneath the cursor.

3.3 Interdiction
----------------
Every air point allocated to interdiction acts as reduce operation points
received by enemy units.  The more points allocated the greater the effect.
Enemy units are randomly effected.

3.4 Ground Attack
-----------------
Every enemy unit in the hex under attack has a 50% chance of being disrupted.
In addition, units in travel mode have a 33% chance of being strafed. Disrupted
units use half of their efficiency. Strafed units use 30% of their combat
strength and are changed to normal mode.

3.5 Air Drops
-------------
Air points not used in the Air Phase may be used air drops in the unit
Organization Phase.  An air drop in a hex brings all units up one supply level
(isolated to unsupplied and unsupplied to supplied).

4.0 SUPPLY PHASE
================
Unit may be in three supply states: supplied, unsupplied, or isolated.  Units
must have a supply line to a road that exits off a friendly map edge.  See 13.7
for examples of supply.

4.1 Supply Trace
----------------
to be in supply a unit must be able to trace a line of supply no more than two
hexes, unblocked by enemy hexes, to a supplied road.  A supplied road is one
that can trace a line of mad hexes off a friendly map edge, unblocked by enemy
hexes. American friendly map edges are the north, south and west edges.  The
Germans have only the east map edge.  An enemy hex is one that either contains
an enemy unit or one that was last entered by an enemy unit.  Players do not
need to concern themselves with the actual trace.  The computer does it for all
units.  Note that enemy zones of control (hexes next to enemy units) do not
block the supply trace.

4.2 Supply States
-----------------
A unit is supplied if its supply trace is successful.  A unit is unsupplied if
not successful.  A unit is isolated if it is unsupplied, surrounded by enemy
zones of control or units (zones of control must be exerted by a adjacent enemy
units to be effective), and not under the command control of a division.  A
unit is under the command control of a division by being itself a divisional
unit, or by being on or adjacent to a hex containing a divisional unit.

4.3 Supply Effects
------------------
Unsupplied units have their operation points halved.  They not only fail to
recover efficiency, but also suffer an additional efficiency loss.  They have
their modified combat strength cut by 25% when defending and 50% when attacking
and may not transfer artillery in or out.  Bridge blowing or building and
fortifying may not be performed by unsupplied units.  Isolated and unsupplied
units may not change to travel mode.  In addition such units are automatically
changed to normal mode if in travel mode when their status changes in the
Supply Phase unless their status changes due to the random fuel effect.
   Isolated units suffer the same penalties as unsupplied units with some
differences.  Their modified combat strength is cut by 50% when defending, they
receive zero operation points, and three is a 40% chance that they will
surrender when attacked.  As implied, isolated units may not attack.

4.4 Supply Exceptions
---------------------
American units are automatically considered in supply on December 16th and 17th
(the first two game turns).  German units are in supply through December 18th
(turn three).
   Starting on December 20th (turn five) there is a 12% chance that any
isolated German unit will run out of fuel, such units are given an unsupplied
status.  In respective of the supply trace.

5.0 REINFORCEMENT PHASE
=======================
The computer will automatically enter reinforcements on the map edges according
to the Order of Battle Chart located at the back of the rules book.

5.1 Entry Hexes
---------------
If the entry hex of a reinforcement unit is enemy occupied or its entry would
violate stacking the unit will enter a nearby map edge road hex.  Entry hexes
are listed on the Order of Battle Chart for reinforcing units.

5.2 Delayed Arrival
-------------------
Each side is allowed only so many units on the map at one time.  The American
may have fifty-seven and the German seventy.  If a reinforcing unit would
violate this limit then the unit's arrival is delayed that turn.  The player
would have to build up units or through combat, lose & unit in order for the
reinforcing unit to appear the next turn.  For every 50 combat points exited
off the map by the German player the American player has the very next
reinforcing unit on the north or west map edge permanently delayed.

6.0 UNIT ORGANIZATION PHASE
===========================
During the phase players may perform several operations including artillery
transfer, unit build-up and breakdown, bridge blowing and building, inputting
replacements, and exiting units from the map.

6.1 Cursor Menu
---------------
while in this menu a player may choose the following functions:
   (0-6): 0, centers the screen and 1-6, moves the cursor in the indicated
   direction.

   (G)et: Accesses the unit in the hex beneath the cursor.

   (Q)uit: Exits the current player's Unit Organization Phase.

   (D)isplay: Pressing this key will change the time its takes for the
   computer to clear the screen after certain displays.  The number in
   parentheses is the current display time.  The higher the number, the
   longer the displays will stay on the screen.  Pressing the key will change
   the number by one.  When ten is reached, the next number accessed is zero.

   (T)errain: Removes all unit shapes from the map to expose the terrain under-
   neath.  Press any key to return units.

6.2 Unit Menu
-------------
When the (G)et function is used from the cursor menu and there is more than one
unit in the hex, a list of the units is displayed.      from one to two or
three.  Pressing a number will access that unit while pressing (Q)uit will
return to the cursor menu.

6.3 Unit Organization Menu
--------------------------
An accessed unit will have it's statistics and conditions displayed (see
example at end of rules book for explanation of display).  At the bottom of the
display is a list of actions of functions that may be performed.

   (A)rtillery: Artillery transfers
   (M)ax Artillery: Gives the unit maximum artillery allowed.
   (R)eplacements: Replacement allocation Numbers indicate available
   replacement pools.
   (B)uild up Breakdowns: Allows building up and breaking down of regiments and
   divisions.
   (P)ools: Display artillery pools available in the corps for transfer.
   (D)estroying Bridges: Activates bridge blowing.
   (C)onstructing Bridges: Activates bridge building.
   (Q)uit: Returns to cursor menu
   (G)et: Accesses units in hex.
   (S)upply Air drop: Drops supplies (see 3.5 Air Drops)

6.4 Artillery Transfers
-----------------------
All units that belong to a division may transfer to or from their corresponding
Artillery Corps Pool (see Artillery Corps Pool Table).  Only units that belong
to a division may contain artillery.  Isolated units may not transfer artillery
.  At the beginning of the turn all artillery points contained by units are
transferred back into the Artillery Corps Pools.
   American units may contain up to 30 artillery points per stacking point.
German units may contain up to 33 points for the first three turns and 15
points thereafter.  A unit automatically returns half of its artillery to the
pool for every hex moved into (except retreats).  Artillery points may be
permanently lost due to combat.
   Artillery Corps Pool may receive additional points as reinforcements (see
Artillery Corps Pool Table).  German pools actually use points early in the
game to reflect the mobility of their artillery.

6.5 Replacements
----------------
Starting December 19th (turn four) both players may input replacements into
infantry and armored formations.  Independent units and battalion formations
may not receive replacements.  Units must be supplied to receive replacements.
The American may input 15 infantry points and 10 armored points per turn.  The
German may input 10 infantry and 15 armored points.  Replacements may not be
accumulated from turn to turn.  Replacements available are displayed on the
Unit Organization Menu.

6.6 Build-ups and Breakdowns
----------------------------
Two or three regiments of the same division may build-up into a divisional
unit.  A regiment may also build into its already present divisional unit.
Units must be in the same hex to build-up into the parent divisional unit.
A divisional unit may breakdown into a component regiments.  Unit strengths,
efficiencies, and fort level are added together to averaged as appropriate in
the build-up and breakdown process.  A unit(s) assumes in supply status of the
unit issuing the command.  Built-up or broken down units assume a normal mode.
   Breakdown will not be permitted if the unit limit of the player would be
exceeded.  The remaining number of available unit slots is displayed in
parentheses, following the build-up Breakdown command.  A divisional unit will
have a stacking value equal to the number of units built into it.  Some
divisions contain four regiments.  Only three of those may build up into the
divisional unit since only three stacking points are allowed in a hex.
   Divisional units may not change into travel mode.  They receive a 25% combat
strength bonus.

6.7 Bridges
-----------
Bridges may be blown and rebuilt at bridge sites (see map) by adjacent units
for an operation point cost (see Operation Costs Table).  Only engineer units
may build bridges for the Germans.  Any American unit may conduct bridge
operations.  Isolated units or units in travel mode may not perform bridge
operations.
   A unit may only make a bridge blowing attempt once a turn.  Engineer units
have 50% chance of being successful and all others have a 35% chance.  Bridge
building is automatic.  Units cannot build bridges when next to an enemy unit.
   Mobile units except for engineers and panzergrenadiers may cross a river
only through a bridge when in travel mode.  The first German unit across a
bridge (that current turn) incurs no additional operation point cost.  Each
German unit thereafter has two more operation point cost (+2) to cross that
bridge than the previous unit.

7.0 OPERATION PHASES
====================
During these phases players expend operation points performing actions that
include: moving, changing mode, plotting combat and advances, and fortifying.

7.1 Cursor Menu
---------------
While in this menu a player may choose the following functions:

  (0-6): 0, centers the screen and 1-6, moves the cursor in the indicated
  direction.

  (G)et: Accesses the unit(s) in the hex beneath the cursor.

  (C)ombat: Exits the Operations Phase and activates combat resolution.

  (T)errain: Removes all unit shapes from the map to expose the terrain
  underneath.  Press any key to return units.

7.2 Unit Menu
-------------
When the (G)et function is used from the cursor menu and there is more than one
unit in the hex, a list of the units is displayed, numbered from one to two or
three.  Pressing a number will access that unit while pressing (Q)uit will
return to the cursor menu.

7.3 Command Menu
----------------
An accessed unit will have a number of available commands displayed with some
unit statistics below the actual game map.  Below are listed the commands from
which the unit may choose.

  (A)dvance: Order unit to advance after combat.  An "Y" after this command
  signifies that the unit will advance while an "N" signifies that it will not.

  (0-6): Centers and moves unit under the cursor.

  (F)ort: Fortify one level.  The number following is the current fort level.

  (M)ode: Changes mode.  Letter indicate present mode (T=Travel and N=Normal).

  (D)isplay: Displays unit conditions and statistics.

  (G)et: Accesses units in the hex.

  (Q)uit: Returns to cursor menu.

  (T)errain: Removes units from the map.

  (E)xit: Exits German unit from eligible map edge.

7.4 Operation Point Allowances
------------------------------
Units of both sides receive operation points at the beginning of the turn and
then again at the beginning of the second operation phase.  The number of
operation points received is dependent upon a unit's base allowance, air
interdiction mode, and supply state.  The following are base allowances of the
various unit types (#/#, first number is operation points received at beginning
of turn and second is number received the second operations phase):

   German

   PZ divisions and regiments           - 24/10
   PZ brigades and PZGR units            - 20/10
   Piper's PZ regiment                  - 32/10
   RCN (reconnaissance) units           - 28/10
   ENG                                  - 20/10
   VG, FJ, and ENG                      - 12/6


   American

   Armored units                        - 15/20
   Cavalry units                        - 20/20
   Infantry, Airborne, and ENG          -  9/9

In addition to the second phase's base allowance a unit will accumulate a
portion of the beginning allowance, unused in the first phase.  American mobile
units may have a maximum of 24 and German mobile 20 operation points for the
second phase and non-mobile units 12 points.  Non-mobile American units receive
double their regular allowance if in travel mode.  Operation point allowances
are cut in half for unsupplied units and reduced to zero for isolated units.
There is no second phase allowance on December 16th (the first turn of the
game).

7.5 Moving a Unit
-----------------
To move a unit simply press 1-6, corresponding to the direction you wish to move
(as indicated by the compass on the display).  The operation point cost of the
hex moved into will be subtracted from the unit's remaining operation points
(see Operation Costs Table for complete list of costs).
   If a unit has insufficient operation points to move into a hex it will not
move unless the unit hasn't yet moved that turn and the hex being moved into is
not adjacent to an enemy unit.  The unit is then moved and its operation points
is reduced to zero.

7.6 Zones of Control, Movement Restrictions and Stacking
--------------------------------------------------------
The six hexagons surrounding a unit constitutes its zone of control (ZOC).
Units must pay an additional operation point cost to enter or leave an enemy
ZOC.  Units moving in normal mode directly from one enemy ZOC to another have
their operation points reduced to zero.  Fortifying costs more when in an enemy
ZOC.  To be isolated unsupplied units must be surrounded by enemy ZOC (of enemy
units adjacent to them).  Bridge building may not be conducted in enemy ZOC.
Units that must retreat into an enemy ZOC lose extra casualties.  The 150th
German Panzer Brigade does not pay ZOC costs through December 17th (turn two).
This unit had a special infiltrating mission and was composed mainly of
captured American equipment.
   German units may not move into the zero hexrow of the X coordinate of the
map (the leftmost vertical hexrow).  This rule exists to limit unrealistic
German control of the southern hexrow and allows ample room for reinforcing
American units.  American units except (or those indicated on the Order of
Battle Chart, may not enter X coordinate hexrows eleven through seventeen
inclusive through December 22nd (turn seven).  This restriction is in effect
only if the Historical option is used when first setting up the game.  This
restriction reflects the command control and communications problems the
Americans experienced between the northern and southern portions of the
battlefield that allowed German Panzer formations to reach Houffalize and cross
the Ourthe River relatively early.
   Units may not use road movement costs unless in travel mode (see 7.2 Travel
Mode).  Mobile units except for engineers and Panzergrenadiers may only cross
a river in Travel mode at a bridge.  Engineer units reduce operation point
costs for units crossing rivers in normal mode if the engineer unit occupies
either hex of the river crossing.
   Each non-divisional unit has a stacking value of one.  A divisional unit has
a stacking value equal to the number of units built into.  No more than three
stacking points may be in a hex at any one time.  Units in travel mode pay one
more operation point to stack with friendly units to normal mode.  Units in
travel mode may not stack together (except receiving reinforcements).

7.7 Travel Mode and Road Movement
---------------------------------
   Unit may change from normal to travel mode or from travel to normal mode at
the cost of operation points (see Operation Costs Table).  An unsupplied or
isolated unit may not change to travel mode.  American non-mobile units have
their remaining operation points doubled when they enter travel mode.  Units
in travel mode change automatically to normal mode when strafed.  Travel mode
units have their modified combat strength reduced by 40%.
   Units may only use road movement costs when in travel mode.  Units in travel
mode may only move into a hex that hex a white hexside in common with its
current hex.  That white hexside represents a road connecting the two hexes
thrown on the C64).  Travel mode units expand an additional point to stack.
Travel mode units may not stack with each other except when first received as
reinforcements.

7.8 Fortifications
------------------
Unit may fortify to five levels by expending the operation point cost (see
Operation Cost Table).  Fortification costs more when the unit is next to an
enemy unit.  Fortification costs less when an engineer unit in normal mode is
present.  When a unit moves its fortification level returns to zero.  A unit's
modified combat strength when defending is increased by 30% per level of
fortification.  A unit's chances of retreating are also decreased when
fortified.

7.9 Plotting Combat and Advancing After Combat
----------------------------------------------
Both the defender and attacker expend operation points in combat if a unit
attacks in the second operations phase all remaining operation points are used.
A unit that attempts to move onto an enemy unit will plot combat against that
hex provided the unit has sufficient operation points.  The direction that the
unit attacked will now be displayed whenever the unit is accessed.  Combat
plots may not be rescinded.
   A unit may designate itself to advance after combat.  It will advance if
eligible.

7.10 Exiting German Unit
------------------------
The German player may exit units off the map from specific hexes (see map) on
the west and north map edges.  Such units may never reenter the game.
   Exited German units gain victory points every turn.  These points are not
added to the score until the end of the game, provided that the hex exited from
is still in German supply.  For every 50 combat points of units exited the
American player has his very next reinforcing unit on the north of west map
edge permanently delayed from entering the game.

8.0 COMBAT
==========
When the Combat Phase is initiated each combat plotted by the player is
resolved in order of the actual plotting.  The combat strengths for both sides
are added up and modified by various factors to determine the battle odds.
Losses are then determined and distributed among the participating units.
Retreats and advances are executed by the computer for eligible units.  Odds,
losses, and retreat results are displayed on the screen.  In addition, the
approximate, unmodified combat strength and hex location of the defender are
also displayed.

8.1 Efficiency
--------------
Each unit has an efficiency that ranges from 40% to 100%.  A unit's combat
strength is directly modified by its efficiency (a combat strength of 50 with
80% efficiency would have a modified strength of 45).  Efficiency represents
fatigue and disruption incurred by a unit from movement and combat.  A unit
loses efficiency for every hex it moves into (except when in travel mode).  A
unit loses efficiency in battle according to its losses.  Attacking units will
lose more efficiency than defending units on a per loss basis.  Isolated and
unsupplied units lose efficiency at the beginning of each turn.
   Units supply regain some efficiency at the beginning of each turn.  Any
unused operation points from the previous movement phase recover efficiency on
a point for point basis at the beginning of the turn.

8.2 Combat Strength Modifiers and Bonuses
-----------------------------------------
The terrain of the defender will modify his strength according to the Combat
Modified Table.  The attacker will be cut by 25% attacking across a river
hexside.  A units fortification level will increase its strength when defending
by 30% per level.  Unsupplied units have their attack strengths cut by 50% and
their defense cut by 25%.  Isolated units may not attack and are cut by 50%
when defending.
   After the above modifiers are applied, the unit any divisional bonuses are
the applied.  Artillery points for the attacker and defender are then added to
the strength totals.  Artillery points for the attacker are halved against
towns and reduced by 10% per fort level.  A unit may not be modified by more
than triple its combat strength, excluding divisional bonus and artillery.

8.3 Casualties
--------------
The attacker's losses are based on its unmodified combat strength, a random and
a constant.  The defender's losses are based on the attacker's losses, odds and
a random.  In addition losses are incurred by artillery.  The defender loses
one strength point per twenty enemy artillery points and the attacker loses one
strength point per ten enemy artillery points.  Losses are distributed to units
proportionately based on combat strength.

8.4 Retreats and Advances
-------------------------
Retreats are based on the percent of casualties lost, unit efficiencies,
fortification levels and a random.  Units in towns and units without retreat
routes will not retreat, but will incur an additional strength loss.  Unit
retreating into an enemy ZOC will incur additional casualties.
   The computer will automatically retreat and advance units.  Generally, units
will retreat toward friendly lines away from the attacking force.  The first
unit to plot the attack will advance first if eligible.  Units will not advance
or retreat where normally prohibited in regular movement.  Units expend
operation points when retreating on advancing (except ZOC costs).  A unit will
advance or retreat even if it has insufficient operation points.

9.0 WEATHER
===========
Weather affects the number of air points that each side receives.  A ground
freeze starting December 24th (turn nine) and lasting until the end of the game
is independent of the weather (see Operation Combat Table).  Below is a chart
that shows the chances of the various types of weather occurring by turns:

  December 16th and 17th - 100% Overcast

  December 18th through 21st - 80% Overcast and 50% Fog

  December 22nd through 24th - 18% Overcast and 34% Fog and 50% Clear

  December 25th through 27th - 34% Fog and 66% Clear


10.0 VICTORY CONDITIONS
=======================
The German gains victory points taking the exiting units eliminating
American units, having a lesser percent of its combat strength eliminated, and
controlling road hexes north of St. Hubert and west of the Ourthe River.  The
German player loses points for eliminated German units and having a greater
percent of its combat strength eliminated than the American.  The total points
are used to determine the level of victory.

10.1 Victory Points
-------------------
At the end of the game the German receives 25 point per town that he controls
(50 points for Bastogne).  He also will receive 25 points per turn for holding
the towns below the German receives 50 points per turn for Bastogne 7.13).

German units that exit the eligible west or north map edges (see map) receive
points based on the turn they exit and combat strength.  A unit receives one
victory point per three combat point per turn that it has exited provided the
road hex it exited from is still in supply at the end of the game.
   The German receives 50 points per eliminated American stacking point and
loses 50 points per eliminated German stacking point.  Engineers and battalion
sized units do not count.
   At the end of the game the percent of combat strength left for each side
will be determined.  For every percentage point that the German has more than
the American, he receives 20 points.  For every percentage point less than the
American, he loses 20 points.
   At the end of the game the German will receive 3 points per controlled,
supplied road hex north of St. Hubert and west of the Ourthe River.

10.2 End of Game and Victory Levels
-----------------------------------
When the game ends the program will continue to the next turn's Supply Phase to
calculate victory points.  At this time you will be allowed to access units on
both sides to examine them.
   The German score at the end of the game is compared to the chart below for
the level of victory.

   (1)     (2)      Level of Victory

  1000    1600      American Strategic
  1100    1700      American Tactical
  1200    1800      Draw
  1700    2300      German Tactical
  1900    2700      German Strategic

The (1) column refers to the First Seven Day scenario and the (2) column refers
to the Last Seven Day scenario and the Twelve Day scenario.  The points listed
are the minimum needed to attain that level of victory.

11.0 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY
==========================
In September 1944 the German army was on the verge of defeat.  On the Western
Front the Germans were outnumbered nearly 2:1 in divisions.  The British/U.S.
forces had reached the Westwall defenses on the German border.  On the Eastern
Front the Russians had driven to East Prussia and had conquered most of
Rumania.  In Italy the Germans had been slowly pushed back to the Po Valley in
northern Italy.  During June, July and August the Germans had suffered
tremendous losses in manpower and there were shortages in tanks, ammunition
and fuel.
   Hitler then had an inspiration to launch a counterattack from the Ardennes
with the objective being the large port of Antwerp which the British had
captured intact.  If Antwerp could be taken, it would cut off the entire
British/Canadian Armies, the Ninth U.S. Army and part of the First U.S. Army
in Holland and Belgium.
   During August and September the Western Allies had driven across France and
Belgium to the German border.  The Germans still held onto some of the major
ports on the coast which forced the Allies to haul supplies from the Normandy
beachhead.  The Allied supply line was therefore extremely stretched and
incapable of supplying all the forces at once.  Hitler guessed that this would
give him time to prepare his defenses along the Westwall and build up his
strength in order to launch the counterattack.  The autumn rain and mud would
also help to slow down the Allied attacks.
   Due to the powerful Allied air force which controlled the skies.  Hitler
needed a few days of overcast weather to begin this attack and break through
to reach Antwerp.  The Ardennes sector was thinly held by both sides and was
used as a resting place for worn out units which had taken heavy losses (4th
and 28th Infantry Divisions) or a place to put newly arrived units in the line
(106th Infantry Division).  By concentrating the German forces on a narrow
front.  Hitler hoped to quickly pierce the front line and strike for the Meuse
River crossings and then take Antwerp.  The heavily wooded Ardennes area would
provide excellent cover to conceal the buildup of forces near the front line.
   Initially the Germans had 13 Infantry and 7 Panzer Divisions in the assault.
Against them were 5 Infantry Divisions, 3 Cavalry Regiments, and 1 Armored
Division.
   During the early morning hours of December 16, 1944 the Germans unleashed
their long awaited counteroffensive.  A tremendous artillery barrage was fired
disrupting Allied communications and causing panic in some of the green
American units.  The Germans quickly infiltrated through the scattered U.S.
positions and soon had overrun or surrounded the 28th and 106th Infantry
Divisions and the 14th Cavalry Division.  Two regiments of the 106th Infantry
were isolated, their retreat route blocked by advancing German units.  They
surrounded on December 19th.
   By December 19, the 2nd 99th, and 9th Infantry Divisions securely held the
line extending northward and from Elaenborn.  Any further attacks would be
repulsed with heavy losses.  Piper/1SS had managed to get to Stoumont, but was
now out of fuel and nearly surrounded by reinforcing American units.  The 1st
and 30th Infantry Divisions held the area from Elsenborn to Stoumont.  The 7th
Armored, 424/106, and 112/28 held the Fortified Goose Egg which included the
area around St. Vith stretching to Vielsam.  The 82nd Airborne was deploying
along the Salm River from Trois Ponts to Vielsam and westward to a point a few
miles south of Manhay.  The 101st Airborne Division had just barely arrived
in Bastogne in time.
   By the 19th the 116th Panzer Division had reached Houflalize and was looking
for a bridge site over the Ourthe River.  The 2nd Panzer Division was north of
Bastogne and Panzer Lehr was just to the east of Bastogne.  The 5th
Fallschirmjager Division was about to enter Wiltz and the 352nd Infantry had
taken Diekirch and was moving on Ettelbruck.
   By December 23, Bastogne was surrounded by the German 26th VG Division and
part of Panzer Lehr.  The 2nd Panzer Division was close to Marche.  The 116th
Panzer was attacking the U.S. 3rd Armored in Hotton.  The remnants of the
American forces who had held the Fortified Goose Egg had just withdrawn across
the Salm River by Vielsam.  They had held against German advance for a full
week giving the Allies the precious time needed to form a defensive line
further to the west.  The 1st SS and 9th SS Panzer Divisions were attacking
from Trois Ponts to Vielsam.
   By December 27, the 2nd Panzer Division had been mauled by the U.S. and
2nd Armored Division near Celles and had to retreat back to Rockhefort.  The
9th Panzer was attacking the 84th Infantry near Marche.  The 9th SS Panzer had
pushed the 82nd Airborne which was now holding a line from Trois Ponts to
Manhay.  The U.S. 4th Armored Division managed to open a narrow corridor into
Bastogne and had linked up with the valiant defenders of the 101st Airborne.
On the south flank the Germans held positions across the Sure River against
attacks by the 80th, 26th and 35th Infantry Divisions.
   On January 2 the Allies would begin their counterattack to reduce the bulge
created by the German offensive.  By the end of January the front lines would
be back to where they were on December 16.
   The German breakthrough in the Ardennes failed for a number of reasons.  The
tenacious American defense at key road functions delayed the German advance
enough to allow American reinforcements to arrive on the battlefield and deploy
American reinforcements arrived much sooner than the Germans thought possible
whereas German reserves were committed too late.  The road net quickly became
very congested, traffic being jammed far behind the forward advancing units.
In addition poor weather conditions created extremely treacherous roads.
American airpower proved devastating to any German vehicles moving along the
roads during daylight hours in clear weather.  The failure to capture key road
centers also caused traffic to back up soon after the initial German assault
was made.  German stocks of fuel and artillery ammunition were running low.
All of these factors doomed the German breakthrough in the Ardennes and ended
any hope of a quick German victory.

12.0 STRATEGY & TACTICS
=======================
After playing the game several times the designers and playtesters give the
following suggestions:

German Player
-------------
Plan ahead where you wish to make your major attacks.  Earmark those areas to
receive fresh reinforcing divisions and artillery assignments.  When units
arrive at the front build up into divisions for maximum penetrating power.
Make the most out of the first few turns when American reaction is slow.
Taking the divisions at hand, drive up the Houttalize corridor and cross the
Ourthe River as soon as possible.  Once across the Ourthe strike toward
Rochefort and the edge of the map.  As you do this, surround and contain
Bastogne, bringing up fresh divisions to wear down the defenses.  Allocate two
or three divisions to protect the southern flank from reinforcing American
units.  Remember that roads are the key to supplying your units.  Seize and
maintain a good road net along your avenues of advance.  Examine the victory
conditions carefully and plan accordingly.

American Player
---------------
You must use your forces at hand carefully to maximize slowing down the German
advance.  Holding key road junctions or placing road junctions in your ZOC will
most effectively slow the German advance.  Take special care in placing the
independent units that are allowed to enter the Houffalize corridor.  The
German potential for deep penetration and/or breakthrough is greatest in this
area.  Blow the bridges across the Ourthe River to slow the German advance.  If
units are being encircled by German forces either pull back or divisionalize to
prevent from being isolated.  Towns are potential strongpoints (and worth
victory points), so think twice before you abandon one.  When your reinforce-
ments have arrived at the front and the German advance has been slowed, plan
your counterattacks carefully, utilizing divisionalized units, fresh units, air
strikes, and artillery.  Attack where the German is vulnerable and where a
supply route can be exposed.  Retake towns and push the German east of the
Ourthe River where possible.

Notes
-----
(1) The ground freeze start DEC 24
(2) Units must be in travel mode
(3) +2 per German unit that crosses the bridge that turn.  No additional cost
    for American units.
(4) Engineer rate applies if engineer is at either side of river crossing
(5) If a unit in normal mode has just exited an enemy ZOC, its operation points
    are reduced to zero
(6) American non-mobile units incur double (twelve) the cost to leave travel
    mode
(7) Exception: Panzergrenadiers may cross rivers at a cost of 4 points with an
    engineer and 8 points without
(8) Units that attack in the second operation phase have their operation points
    reduced to zero

Units numbered 1-6 are American and units lettered A-D are German.  American
units 1,3,4,5 and 6 are supplied.  Unit 2 is unsupplied because it cannot trace
supply within two hexes of a friendly supplied road hex.  German A is supplied.
Unit B is isolated and units C and D are unsupplied.  Unit B is isolated
because it is unable to trace supply and is surrounded by enemy ZOC (of enemy
units next to it).  Unit C is unsupplied due to a blocked supply trace.  It
would be isolated if it wasn't next to a divisional unit since it is surrounded
by enemy ZOC.  Unit D has a blocked supply trace and would be isolated if it
wasn't a divisional unit.

(3) +2 per German unit that crosses the bridge that turn.  No additional cost
    for American units.
(4) Engineer rate applies if engineer is at either side of river crossing
(5) If a unit in normal mode has just exited an enemy ZOC, its operation points
    are reduced to zero
(6) American non-mobile units incur double (twelve) the cost to leave travel
    mode
(7) Exception: Panzergrenadiers may cross rivers at a cost of 4 points with an
    engineer and 8 points without
(8) Units that attack in the second operation phase have their operation points
    reduced to zero
