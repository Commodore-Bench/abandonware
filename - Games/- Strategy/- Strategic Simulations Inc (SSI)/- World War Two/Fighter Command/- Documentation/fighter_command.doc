1.0 INTRODUCTION

   Fighter Command is a strategic game that allows players to recreate the 
Battle of Britain The game covers the critical period from 13 August through 
15  September 1940, when the few hundred pilots of RAF Fighter Command held 
the fate of England in their hands. Players direct the RAF squadrons and 
Luftwaffe Gruppen which participated in the battle, observing the movement of 
units in response to their tactical guidance on any of four maps of southern 
England.
       Fighter Command can be played either as a 2-player game, or solitaire, 
with the computer playing the German Side. Before playing the game for the 
first time, it is recommended that you read the rules at least through 
section 10, paying particular attention to sections 5 and 6, which describe 
the commands and options available to the German and British players. Then 
become familiar with the Player Aid cards, especially the map showing the 
location of cities, airfields, radar sites, assembly points, etc. Finally, 
boot the game disk and select the one-day Eagle Day scenario from the 
start-up menu, since it is the shortest and easiest to learn.
1.1 Starting a Game (DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3)
    To begin a game, boot your game disk and the game will begin 
automatically if you are using an Apple II with Pascal, you must first use 
your BASICS disk. If you are using an Apple III, you must first go into Apple 
II Emulation Mode.
1.2 Saving a Game
    At the end of each "day", and at the end of each player's briefing and 
orders phase, you will be asked if you wish to save the game in progress. If 
you choose to save the game, you will need a scratch disk to store the data. 
The scratch disk must be initialized for SSI use by following the 
instructions included in the program Once the game is saved, you will be able 
to restart it from the point at which you left off.

2.2 Definition of Terms
2.2.1 Altitude - The elevation in thousands of feet that a unit is assigned 
to fly in performing its mission.
2.2.2 Assembly Point - One of 4 locations over German-occupied france where 
Luftwaffe forces assemble before moving in formation toward their objective. 
A fifth North Sea "Assembly Point" is really an "arrival point", where 
Lufflotte % aircraft from Norway first appear on the map.
2.2.3 Bomb load - The weight, in hundreds of pounds, of bombs typically 
carried on a mission against England by a single Luftwaffe aircraft in 1940.
2.2.4 Damage Points - A measure of total damage inflicted by Luftwaffe 
aircraft on British cities, airfields or radar sites. One damage point is 
equal to a one per cent reduction in the production or operating capability 
the target.
2.2.5  Endurance - The length of time a particular aircraft type may remain 
in the air before being forced to land for refueling.
2.2.6 Escort Tactic - The procedures to be followed by German fighters 
while escorting bombers on a mission. Options are High, low and Close.
2.2.7 Experience - A measure of the average amount of combat experience of 
the pilots in a unit. Values range from a low of 0 to a high of 9. Experience 
and morale are measured in increments of .1 (tenths).

Luftflotte, or Air fleet, is the highest organizational subdivision of the 
Luftwaffe.
2.2.10  Morale - A measure of the enthusiasm, spirit, dedication, etc , of 
a unit. Values range from a low of 0 to a maximum of 9.
2.2.11 Radar Site - An installation located on the southern or eastern 
coast of England, which was used to detect groups of flying aircraft There 
were two types of radar sites. Chain Home (CH), designed to detect 
high-flying aircraft, and Chain Home low (CHL), for the detection of low 
flying aircraft.
2.2.12 RAF/Fighter Command/Group - The RAF is the Royal Air Force; Fighter 
Command is the RAF organization containing aIl fighter aircraft, and a Group 
is the highest organizational subdivision of fighter Command.
2.2.13 Readiness - The alert state of a British unit. Extremes are Runway 
Alert, where the planes are lined up on the runway with engines running, 
waiting to take off, and 2-Hour Call, where units don't have to be available 
until 2 hours after being notified.
2.2.14 Sector Airfield - A major airfield which is the headquarters for 
several squadrons, some of which may be based at separate satellite 
airfields.
2.2.15  Serviceable Aircraft - The number of aircraft available for 
immediate operations, usually about 75 -90% of the total aircraft in a unit.
2.2.16 Time/Time Step - Time is indicated according to the 24-hour clock. 
Possible hours of play each day are 0600-1 800. Play proceeds in time steps 
of 2 minutes each, during the time German aircraft are in the air.
2.2.17 Unit - The smallest operational air organization in the game for the 
RAF, this is the Squadron, usually consisting of 12-18 aircraft, and 
identified by a number (eg, 74 Squadron) The standard Luftwaffe unit is the 
Gruppe, which normally contains 30-36 aircraft. It is identified by a type 
abbreviation and one or two numbers (eg, JG 26/1).
2.3 Map Descriptions
  The basic game map is a section of southern England, northwestern france, 
and the English Channel A status board summary of currently detected German 
raids is shown on the right side of the screen, with the current time 
displayed just below this area Text messages are displayed on the bottom 
portion of the screen British airfields are denoted on the map by a green 
plus (+) symbol, radar sites by a white dot, and cities by an orange region 
The estimated location of German raids are indicated by a swastika symbol, 
and British squadrons in the air are denoted by a rounded symbol.
   The scale of the basic map is approximately 2 miles per screen plotting 
element (pixel); the map covering a 270 by 200 mile area, Three additional 
maps are available, covering important portions of the main map on a more 
detailed scale of approximately one-half mile per pixel. These maps each 
cover an area of approximately 90 by 60 miles.

3.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

   There are 5 different scenarios in Fighter Command covering from one to 34 
days. The sequence of play for each day is summarized below.
3.1 German Briefing Phase
   During this phase the German player will be able to review the results of 
the prevIous day's action, determine the operational readiness of the 
different types of aircraft in each of his 3 Luftflotten, examine the latest 
intelligence estimates on damage to targets in England and on RAF strength, 
and check the latest weather forecast.
3.2 German Orders Phase
   The  German  player orders  his  units to conduct  missions against the 
British.
3.3 British Briefing Phase
   The British player is able to review yesterdays action, check on Fighter 
Command readiness, examine intelligence on Luftwaffe strength and possible 
intentions, and learn what his weather forecasters are predicting.
3.4 British Orders Phase
   The British player may order changes in the readiness state or disposition 
of his units, establish dawn patrol stations, or change his default tactics 
options.
3.5  British Intercept Phase
   The British player observes information presented to him on the mapboard 
display, and takes various actions to defend against the attacking German 
aircraft- He may request information, change readiness states, re-deploy 
units, establish new patrol stations, and assign units t intercept German 
formations The German player may watch the screen during this phase but is 
not allowed to look at displays other than the four maps
3.6 Computer Overnight Activity Phase
   The computer determines the number and disposition of replacement aircraft 
and pilots, updates unit experience and morale factors, evaluates the extent 
of repairs to damaged aircraft and British targets, and prepares reports for 
the following morning briefings.
3.7 Victory Determination Phase
   If the scenario is completed, or if specified victory conditions have been 
achieved, the game is concluded and the final results are displayed.

4.0 GERMAN FORCES

   There are six different German aircraft types which were involved in the 
Battle of Britain. Two of these are fighters, and the other four are 
bombers.Additional information about each aircraft type is available on the 
Player Aid cards, and in the Historical Notes.
4.1.1 ME-109E 'Emil'
   The best German fighter in the game is the Me-109. It is superior to every 
British aircraft, except the Spitfire. The Me-109 also is available in 
greater numbers than any other German aircraft. The one weak point of the 
Me-109 is its endurance; It is only able to escort raids about as far as 
London (See the Player Aid map for a line showing the approximate range limit 
for the Me-109). One Me-109 unit, EG 210/3, can be used as dive bombers.
4.1.2 ME-110C 'Zerstorer'
   The Me-110 is a fast aircraft with good endurance, but is outclassed as a 
fighter by the Spitfire and Hurricane. There are two Me-110 units, EG 210/1 
and EG 210/2, which can be used as dive bombers. 
4.1.3 JU-88A
   The JU-88A is able to outrun the slower British interceptors, but can't 
defend itself very effectively if intercepted.
4.1.4 DO-17Z
   The Do-17 is only found in Luftflotte 2, but it appears there in fairly 
sizable numbers. It is a fast level bomber, with average performance in most 
other categories. 
4.1.5 HE-111H
   Having the heaviest bomb load of a ny German bomber, the He-111 is 
probably best utiIized against industrial targets. It has a relatively low 
ceiling, and is sLower than the other German leveL bombers. 
4.1.6 JU-87B 'Stuka'
   The Stuka is a sLow, vulnerable dive bomber, with a light bomb load, and 
very limited endurance. It can onLy go about as far as the Me-109 (see the 
range limit on the map). In sufficient numbers, however, it can be very 
effective against radar installations in low, hit-and-run raids. 
4.2 Organization
4.2.1 Luftflotte
   The three Luftflotten which participated in the Battle of Britain are 
numbers 2, 3, and 5. The largest of these, Luftflotte 2, also pLayed the most 
important roLe in the Battle from the German side. Located in the northwest 
corner of occupied france, it is in the closest proximity to England.
    Luftflotte 3 is based to the south and west of Luftflotte 2, placing it 
more to the south of England. This Luftflotte contains the bulk of the Stuka 
dive bombers, but no DO-17's.
    Luftflotte 5 is located initially in Norway, a distance of more than 300 
miles from targets in central EngLand. Only 6 units in Luftflotte 5 
participated in the Battle of Britain, and one of these, JG 77/2, could not 
reach England and return with its ME-109s. The German player
will be given the opportunity on 7 September to transfer some or all of the 
Luftflotte 5 units to France. This transfer will have the penalties of 
removing squadrons from action for one day, and of potentially releasing some 
British squadrons from 13 Group to be transferred south.
4.2.2 Geschwader and Gruppe
     The next organizational level below the Luftflotte is the 
Geschwader.These are identified as to type of aircraft according to the 
following notation:
Name                       Description                    Aircraft
JG  Jagdgeschwader          Single-engine fighters         ME-109E
ZG  Zerstorergeschwader     Twin-engine fighters           ME-110C
KG  Kampfgeschwader         Level bombers                  JU-88A
                                                           DO-17Z
                                                           HE-111H
STG Stukageschwader         Dive bombers                   JU-87B
EG  Erprobungsgeschwader    Experimental units             ME-109E
                                                           ME-110C
LG  Lehrgeschwader          Elite training units           Various
  Each Geschwader is composed typically of three Gruppen, designated by Roman 
numerals (Conventional numbers replace Roman numerals in the game, for the 
sake of brevity and display compactness. Three special detached units are 
included in Luftflotte 2. These are termed Kampfgruppe (KGR), and are elite 
specially-trained units.
4.3 Tactics
   The Tactical elements which are within the German players control in 
Fighter Command are formation size, mission altitude, approach direction, 
multiple raid timing, primary and secondary target selection, fighter escort 
doctrine, and the use of feints and sweeps. These options are described more 
completely in the German Raid Scheduling section (6.2)

5.0 BRITISH FORCES

5.1 Aircraft Types
    Five British aircraft types are included in Fighter Command, although 
only two - the Spitfire I and the Hurricane I - participate in significant 
numbers. Additional information about each aircraft type is available on the 
Player Aid cards and in the Historical Notes
5.1.1 Spitfire I 
    The Spitfire is the best British fighter in the game. It is the fastest, 
fastest climbing, and best at dogfighting with German Fighters, particularly 
the Me-109 
5.1.2 Hurricane I
    The most numerous British fighter is the Hurricane. It is second best in 
ability to the Spitfire, being slower, less maneuverable, and having less 
endurance. However, the Hurricane is more than able to deal effectively with 
any German aircraft except the Me-109
5.1.3 Blenheim I
    Designed as a light bomber rather than a fighter, the Blenheim is really 
out of its element going after anything other than unescorted German bombers. 
It has excellent endurance, but is rather slow, and is at a decided 
disadvantage against any German fighters.
5.1.4 Defiant
     The Defiant is, like the Blenheim, fairly effective against German 
bombers, but very ineffective against German Fighters. It is faster than the 
Blenheim, but with much more limited endurance.
5.1.5 Gladiator
    There is only one Gladiator squadron in the game, and it starts with less 
than a full complement of aircraft, so it doesn't play a major role. The 
Gladiators one advantage is a high climb rate, but, like the Blenheim and 
Defiant, it's only effective against German bombers.
5.2 Organization
5.2.1 Groups
      Four Fighter Command Groups were active during the Battle of Britain, 
with 11 Group, located in southeast England, playing the dominant role. 11 
Group contains the best, and the most, aircraft of any of the Groups. Located 
to the west of 11 Group is 10 Group. Its responsibility is the defense of 
southwest England and Wales, particularly against attacks by Luftflotte 3 
from the south. To the immediate north of 11 Group is 12 Group. It serves as 
a back-up to 11 Group for raids to the south and east of London, and defends 
the interior of England. The northernmost Group is 13 Group. Its airfields do 
not appear on the game maps, and so its fighters appear on an initial entry 
point on the north edge of the map, after a suitable delay. The role of 13 
Group is both as a place to allow units to rest and improve their morale, and 
to defend against raids from Norway by Luftflotte 5.
5.2.2 Sectors
   The control of individual Fighter Command squadrons was exercised during 
the Battle of Britain through a network of sector airfields. Controllers at 
the sector airfields directed the squadrons located at the sector airfield, 
as well as squadrons based at satellite airfields. Extensive damage to a 
sector field can have a delaying effect on the operation of squadrons at 
these satellite airfields, as well as at the damaged sector field. (All 
squadrons based at some sector fields were occasionally referred to as a 
Wing, eg, the Kenley WIng.)
5.2.3 Squadrons
     The basic British organizational unit is the squadron. Squadrons are 
designated by a number, with no particular pattern for different aircraft 
types (for example, 600 squadron contains Blenheims, 601 Squadron has 
Hurricanes, and 602 Squadron flies Spitfires)
5.3 Tactics
   Tactical options for the British player include unit deployment locations, 
setting readiness conditions, specifying which German raids are to be 
intercepted by which squadrons, assigning priority to escorts or bombers as 
interception targets, and designating attack urgency and aggressiveness. 
These options are described under the appropriate British Commands sections 
(7.2 and 7.3)

6.0 GERMAN COMMANDS

   The German player initiates the action each day with his Briefing and Raid 
Scheduling phases. Once German forces have been assigned to their targets, 
the role of the German player becomes that of observing the British player's 
responses to his raids.
6.1 German Briefing Phase
   Information is presented to the German player at the beginning of each new 
day in the form of a morning staff briefing. The same four topics - 
Yesterdays operations, readiness, intelligence, and weather - are covered 
each day. A briefing report may be reviewed by pressing the left or right 
arrows until the report name is highlighted, then pressing the space bar.
6.1.1 Yesterdays Operations
     This briefing report presents a summary of the results of any raids 
conducted yesterday.
6.1.2 Intelligence
    The intelligence report provides a summary of damage to British targets 
and British aircraft losses since the start of the scenario. This is in 
contrast to the report on yesterdays operations, which contains intelligence 
on only one days activities. The target damage summary lists all targets 
which have received more than 50% damage, and which German intelligence 
believes have not yet been repaired to less than a 50% damage level. 
Estimates of British initial strength, losses and replacements are used to 
prepare the table of RAF Fighter Command estimated current strength. 
6.1.3 Readiness
   The current status of the Luftwaffe is portrayed in the readiness report. 
Separate pages for each of the three Luftflotten indicate, by aircraft type:
         number of Gruppen
         total number of aircraft
         number of aircraft available for operations
         number of pilots available
         average experience and morale levels
   Totals for all aircraft types in each Luftflotte also are shown, and the 
grand totals for the entire Luftwaffe are shown at the end of the report.
6.1.4 Weather
    The German meteorologists best estimate of the expected percent cloud 
cover over southern England is provided in this report, along with a short 
interpretation of the likely effects of that amount of cloud cover on 
operations. A more complete description of weather and its effects is given 
in section 15.
6.2 Raid Scheduling Phase
    This phase begins with the question "Do you want to launch any raids 
against the British today?" if the answer is "No", then the British intercept 
Phase will be omitted, and play will proceed directly from the subsequent 
British Briefing and Orders Phases to the Computer Overnight Activity Phase. 
if your answer is "Yes"(you do want to launch raids today), then you will be 
prompted through the raid-scheduling process as described below. 
6.2.1 Target Type Selection
    There are three ground target types; airfields, industrial centers, and 
radar stations. There is also the option of assigning units to a FEiNT or 
SWEEP mission (if bombers are present it is a feint. if only fighters are 
assigned, it is a sweep). When all raids have been assigned, the DONE option 
will complete the German Raid Scheduling Phase and all German activity for 
the current day.
6.2.2 Target Selection
    Each raid against a ground target may be assigned both a primary and a 
secondary target. A raid will always proceed to its primary target first, and 
will attack that target unless unable to because of clouds. If the Primary 
target is obscured, the raid will attempt to fly to and bomb its secondary 
target. Feints and sweeps are assigned a turn-around point instead of a 
target. This is the point the raid will fly to before turning around and 
returning to base. There are no secondary targets for feints and sweeps.
    Targets maybe selected either by typing in the name of the target, or 
moving the highlight cursor to the desired target name and pressing the space 
bar.
6.2.3 Assembly Point Selection
    There are five locations used by German aircraft to assemble into their 
bombing formations. These assembly points, and the Luftflotten which can use 
them are:
              Location                  Luftflotte
              Calais                        2
              Dieppe                      2 or 3
              Le Havre                    2 or 3
              Cherbourg                     3
              North Sea                     5
    Selection of an assembly point also determines the Luftflotte assignment 
in three of the five cases, and narrows it down to two in the other two 
cases. Each raid (except from Luftflotte 5) will spend an amount of time 
orbiting its assembly point before proceeding to its assigned target; the 
length of time being proportional to the size and assigned altitude of the 
raid.
6.2.4 Offset Approach Point Selection
    A raid will proceed straight towards its primary target, unless an offset 
approach point is selected. The offset approach point is an intermediate 
point which can be used to deceive the British player about the location of 
the intended target. The penalty for using an offset approach is, of course, 
that the raid will spend more time in the air. This may permit additional 
British squadrons to intercept the raid, and may force short endurance German 
aircraft to return home early. The location of the offset approach point is 
selected using a cursor (+) symbol on the game map. The L, J, K, and M keys 
will move the cursor up, left, right and down, respectively; the space bar 
stops cursor movement, and the A key selects the current cursor location as 
the offset approach point.
6.2.5 Target Arrival Time Selection
    The desired arrival time over the target is entered as a single 3 or 4 
digit number in 24-hour notation (eg, 715, 1430). This will be converted to 
an assembly point departure time, based on the total flying distance to the 
target and the speed of the slowest aircraft in the raid.
6.2.6 Assignment of Forces
     Bomber units are assigned to a raid first, followed by the escorting 
fighters. A running total of the number of fighters and bombers assigned is 
continuously displayed on the top left-hand side of the screen. After a 
particular aircraft type has been chosen, all available German units of that 
type in the previously identified Luftflotte will be displayed on the right 
side of the screen. The left and right arrows can be used to move the 
selection cursor up or down. The number of serviceable aircraft available, 
and the experience and morale levels of the highlighted unit, are shown on 
the left side of the screen. The space bar will select the currently 
highlighted unit.
      Escort tactics must be specified each time a fighter type (ME-109E or 
ME-110C) is selected. The tactics options and their implications for German 
fighter and bomber losses, and British fighter losses, are shown below.
             Escort     German Losses       British Losses
             Tactic   Fighters   Bombers      Fighters
             Close    High       Low           Low
             Loose    Medium     Medium        Medium
             High     Low        High          High
6.2.7 Altitude Selection
    The final item to be specified for a raid is the altitude over the 
target, in kilofeet (thousands of feet). The raid will fly at this same 
altitude from the time it leaves the assembly area until it returns there at 
the completion of its mission. One exception to this is that dive bombers 
will always dive below one thousand feet when releasing bombs over their 
target.
6.2.8 German Availability
    German bombers may only fly one mission per day. German fighters may fly 
two missions per day as long as the target arrival times are at least four 
hours apart.

7.0 BRITISH COMMANDS

7.1 British Briefing Phase
    The British morning briefing covers the same four topics as are covered 
in the German briefing - yesterdays operations, intelligence, readiness, and 
weather - plus a fifth topic - damage summary. To review a report, use the 
right and left arrow keys until the desired report is highlighted, then press 
the space bar.
7.1.1 Yesterdays Operations
    This briefing report summarizes the results of any raids conducted 
yesterday. Information presented includes the number of German raids 
detected, number of targets bombed, and the number of friendly and enemy 
aircraft lost. All numbers are accurate, except for enemy losses, which is an 
estimate (usually optimistic).
7.1.2 Intelligence
    The British intelligence report contains an estimate of the German 
aircraft losses and replacements since the start of the scenario, and the 
estimated Luftwaffe current strength. Just like the German intelligence 
report, the Luftwaffe current strength estimate can be expected to be high 
early in a scenario, and tending toward the low side late in the scenario 
because of the overly optimistic enemy loss estimates.
7.1.3 Readiness
     The current status of each RAF squadron is presented in the readiness 
report. Separate listings for each of the four RAF Groups indicate the number 
of serviceable aircraft, number of pilots, aircraft type and experience, and 
morale levels. A summary at the end presents the total number of serviceable 
aircraft of each type for all of Fighter Command.
7.1.4 Damage Summary 
    The current damage state of each target is presented in this report, 
grouped by target type for airfields and radar sites, the current operational 
status also is indicated.
7.1.5 Weather
    British weather forecasts of the expected cloud cover over southern 
England will usually be more accurate than the German forecasts, but seldom 
perfect. The forecast for the current day is presented in this report, 
accompanied by an interpretation of the likely operational effects of that 
weather.
7.2 British Orders Phase
    Orders which the British player may issue to his forces at the start of 
each day are:
       Change Default Readiness and Tactics
       Establish Fighter Patrol Stations
       Change individual Squadron or Airfield Readiness
       Transfer Squadrons Between Airfields
    Most of the above orders also can be given during the intercept Phase, 
and their use will be covered in more detail in the intercept Phase section 
(7.3).
7.2.1 Change Default Readiness and Tactics
    Default values are used in the absence of any other information as a 
means of minimizing the number of decisions the British player must make 
during the intercept phase. A default readiness state can be specified for 
each of the four Air Groups. All units in a Group will be placed in the 
default readiness state at the start of the day, unless a different state was 
specified using the Change Squadron/Airfield Readiness order.
    Three default tactics can be specified for each British aircraft type 
These tactics are target priority, urgency, and aggressiveness. Target 
priority options are to attack fighters, bombers, or either. The presence of 
German escorting fighters and their tactical doctrine affects the probability 
of attacking the desired target type. Intercept urgency options are immediate 
attack, intermediate, and bounce. An immediate attack will result in the 
highest probability of successful intercept in the shortest possible time, 
but will also cause friendly losses to be higher.The bounce option will take 
longer, but will cause higher enemy losses and lower friendly losses, if 
intercept occurs. Aggressiveness can be specified using a scale of 1 to 9, 
with 1 being cautious and 9 being daring. Increased aggressiveness causes the 
expected losses on both sides to increase.
7.3 British Intercept Phase
   The "play of the game" in fighter Command really takes place during the 
British intercept Phase. In this phase, the British player receives contact 
reports on German raids, assigns interceptors, and adjusts squadron locations  
and readiness states. The commands which are available to allow the British 
player to perform these tasks are described below.
7.3.1 Airfield Status (A)
    This command provides information on the damage state of an airfield. It 
also lists all squadrons currently at the field, their aircraft type, number 
of serviceable aircraft, and alert state.
7.3.2 Britain Map (B)
    This command is used to return the original map of southern England, 
along with the Raid Status Summary Display, to the screen.
7.3.3 Change Readiness (C)
    The readiness state of an individual squadron, or all the squadrons at a 
particular airfield can be changed using this command.
7.3.4 Establish Patrols (E)
    British squadrons can be assigned to patrol stations using this command. 
The cursor is used to select the patrol station location, and then the number 
of the squadron which will occupy that station is requested. The standard 
altitude for patrol stations is ten thousand feet. There may be up to ten 
patrol stations occupied at one time. When  a squadron on patrol has 20 
minutes remaining before being forced to return to refuel, the British player 
will be asked if he wants to send a replacement squadron, or abandon the 
patrol station. Squadrons on patrol which sight a German raid will attempt to 
intercept and attack that raid. Squadrons on patrol may be told to intercept 
a raid by using the 
"I" command and entering the squadron number. In order to 
intercept, the squadron must first reach its own station position.
7.3.5  German Raid identification (G)
    This command will show you the plot symbol for a given raid.
7.3.6 intercept German Raids (I)
    This is the command which permits interceptors to be ordered into the air 
against German raids. The selection of which squadrons to assign can be made 
in one of three ways: identifying the squadron directly, selecting an 
airfield and then choosing a squadron from that field, or listing all 
available squadrons in a particular Group and selecting the intercepting 
squadron from that list. The plot symbol for the squadron will appear as  
soon as the squadron is in the air.
7.3.7 London Map (L)
    This command causes the detailed map of the area around London to be 
displayed.
7.3.8 Midlands Map (M)
    This command causes the detailed map of the Midlands region, just north 
of London, to become the background map.
7.3.9 Pause (P)
    Pause simply causes program execution to be suspended temporarily.
7.3.10 Radar Status (R)
    This command permits determination of the current damage state of all 
radar stations.
7.3.11 Southern Map (S)
    This command causes the detailed map of the southernmost region to be 
displayed.
7.3.12 Transfer Units (T)
    This command is used to move squadrons from one airfield to another. The 
squadron to be transferred is first identified, and then a list of all 
airfields is displayed to aid in the selection of the destination. Transfers 
cause a unit to become unavailable for a 2-hour period upon arrival at its 
new base. Transferred units will remain at their new airfield until 
transferred again. Transfers executed during the British Orders phase will 
occur during the evening (thus the planes will be available for use at 0600) 
Each group may contain up to 35 squadrons.  Each sector airfield may hold up 
to four squadrons while non-sector airfields may hold up to two squadrons.
7.3.13 Group Status (O, 1, 2, 3)
    These commands are used to list all squadrons in a Group, together with 
the aircraft type, number of serviceable aircraft, airfield and alert state. 
The command to use is the last digit of the Group number, eg, a "1" will call 
up the report for 11 Group.

8.0 INTELLIGENCE

    Intelligence is information on the status of enemy forces and targets, 
and on enemy intentions. The accuracy of intelligence information varies from 
very good, to wild guesses. In general, British intelligence will be more 
accurate than the German intelligence, in addition, the British player will 
receive occasional reports on his opponents intended bombing targets, which 
simulates  the use of UlTRA to break the German codes.
8.1 Enemy Forces and Targets
    The morning briefing for each side contains an estimate of the      
current strength of the opponent's air forces. This estimate is based on an 
accumulation of the estimated enemy losses and replacements during the 
battle, and an assumed strength at the start of the scenario. All of these 
estimates will tend to be higher than what is actually true, especially for 
enemy losses. This will cause the total strength estimate to be high early, 
and to tend toward the low side late in the scenario. For the German report, 
the level of opposition encountered in the most recent days raids is used to 
"validate" the intelligence information. The RAF strength estimates will be 
revised upward if higher than expected opposition is encountered, and 
downward if the opposition is lighter than intelligence predictions.
    The German intelligence report contains a listing of all British targets 
which are estimated to have a current damage level greater than 50%. The 
contents of this report are derived from original damage reports from 
returning raids, and from the presumed occurrence of reconnaissance flights. 
Reconnaissance flights do not actually occur in the game, but their likely 
results are reflected in the damage estimates. Therefore, these estimates are 
likely to be better if there was  good weather yesterday, and worse if the 
weather was  bad.
8.2 Special Intelligence
    The British intelligence report occasionally will contain a special piece 
of intelligence information, which is presumed to have come from the breaking 
of German codes. This intelligence will contain the target of one of the 
German raids scheduled for the current day. This information is normally 
quite reliable, and can be used to optimize the British defense against this 
particular raid.

9.0 RADAR AND VISUAL SEARCH

    The two principal means of detecting German raids are radar and visual 
search. German raids will not be reported to the British player until they 
have been detected by one or the other of these methods, or until they bomb 
their target.
9.1 Radar Search
    The British have 26 radar stations located along the south and east 
coasts of England. These radar stations are of two types; Chain Home (CH), 
used to detect high-flying aircraft; and Chain Home low(CHL), used to detect 
low-flying aircraft. There are 12 CH sites and 14 CHL sites, which are 
identified on the map on the Player Aid card, and in the Radar status and 
Damage Summary reports. The CH radars are capable of detecting aircraft up to 
80 miles away, although detection ranges of 30-50 miles are more common. The 
minimum altitude for CH radar detection is 3,000 feet. CHL radars can detect
aircraft flying below 6,000 feet, at ranges out to 40 miles. Radar detection 
probabilities are proportional to the number of aircraft in a raid and the 
altitude at which the raid is flying.
9.2 Visual Detection
    The British Observer Corps are able to detect aircraft flying over 
England. Detection is more likely in better weather and at lower altitudes. 
Large raids are more readily detected than small ones. British fighter 
squadrons on patrol also can make visual detections. This is a useful tactic 
for filling in for damaged radar sites.

10.0 COMBAT

10.1 Air-to-Air
     Combat between aircraft in the air occurs whenever British aircraft 
intercept German raids. Each air-to-air combat is assumed to take place 
between a single British squadron and a single German Gruppe. If more than 
one type of aircraft is  present in a raid, then the particular Gruppe    
which will be engaged by an intercepting squadron is determined by a 
combination of the British target priority tactic, and the German escort 
tactic. Losses inflicted on both sides also are a function of these same 
tactics. Other factors which affect aerial combat results are; weather,  
altitude difference, experience, morale, aircraft types, and British 
aggressiveness and urgency. If a Bomber Gruppe is  engaged by a British 
squadron and German fighter escorts are available, then there is a 
possibility that a fighter Gruppe will counter-attack against the British 
squadron.
    Losses occur to aircraft and pilots separately. An aircraft may be either 
damaged or destroyed, and its pilot may be killed, wounded, or survive. The 
probability of both aircraft and pilot survival is higher the closer a unit 
is to its  home base. All British fighter units will head for their home base 
immediately upon engaging in aerial combat. German bomber units which have 
sustained losses greater than 10% may abort their mission and return to base, 
depending upon the experience and morale of the unit. Once a unit has aborted 
its mission, it may no longer engage or be engaged in combat. German fighter 
units may remain after an engagement (this is influenced by the number of 
enemy planes damaged, ie, the more enemy planes that are damaged in an 
engagement the greater the likelihood that the German unit will head home).
10.2 Air-to-Ground
     The only units which may conduct air-to-ground combat are the German 
bomber Gruppen, and a few specialized fighter-bomber units. These latter 
units are indicated by the designator EG (Erprobungs Gruppe). Whenever
these units are assigned to attack a target, with no pure bomber aircraft 
types present, they will be assumed to be carrying bombs. However, if 
attacked prior to reaching the target, they will jettison their bombs and 
become normal fighters again. The damage inflicted by a German Gruppe bombing 
a target depends upon the number of aircraft their altitude, the type of 
aircraft, the type of target, experience, morale, and the weather. Damage to 
radar stations is subject to considerable variability, since it takes a 
critical hit on the antenna or transmitter building to knock the station off 
the air. Damage to airfields is also quite variable, and damage to aircraft 
on the ground also can vary considerably. Aircraft on runway alert and 
aircraft that take off during the same 2-minute increment in which an 
airfield is bombed will not suffer damage to their aircraft.
    Some aircraft types are more effective against particular target types 
than against others. Dive bombers and fighter-bombers are most effective 
against radar sites, and least effective against industrial targets, while 
the opposite is true of level bombers.
    Each German bombing raid has a 15% chance that it will not attack the 
target due to poor intelligence. Many German missions were flown against 
worthless targets during the campaign due to poor German intelligence. Since 
we do not attempt to hide potential targets from the German player, the 15% 
rule was designed to account for this fog-of-war factor.
10.3 Ground-to-Air
    Each target is defended by anti-aircraft (AA) fire. The intensity of AA 
fire varies by target type, as indicated in the following list of descending 
AA intensity:
       London
       Aircraft industrial targets 
       Other industrial targets 
       Sector airfields
       Satellite airfields
       Radar sites
    Industrial targets are the only ones that have AA capability against 
aircraft flying above 5,000 feet, since very little damage can be inflicted 
on airfields or radar sites by high-flying bombers. Losses to AA fire will be 
less at higher altitudes and in poorer weather.

11.0 PRODUCTION, MAiNTENANCE AND REPAiRS

11.1  Production of New Aircraft
    Each side receives new aircraft at the end of each days' play in 
approximately the same numbers as occurred during the actual Battle of 
Britain. Production of new aircraft for the British is  affected by damage to 
its aircraft industry, however.
    At full capacity, British production of new aircraft is about 6 per day 
for Hurricanes, 3 per day for Spitfires, and 2 per day for Blenheims and 
Defiants. Damage to each aircraft type production centers will reduce output 
in proportion to the current damage level. Damage to avionics industry cities  
will affect the production rate of all aircraft types. There is a 5-day delay 
before damage affects the delivery of aircraft, eg, damage inflicted on the 
first day of play will not affect aircraft deliveries until after the fifth 
day of play.
    German aircraft production rates are approximately 4 per day for Me-109s, 
3 per day for JU-88s, and between 1 and 2 per day for the other aircraft 
types.
    The computer automatically assigns newly delivered aircraft to the units 
which have the fewest number of that particular aircraft type.
11.2 Repair of Damaged Aircraft
    Each squadron or gruppe can repair 1 or 2 aircraft per day, returning 
them to the serviceable category. There is an upper limit of between 75 and 
90% on the number of serviceable aircraft in a unit.
11.3 Repair of Airfields, Radar Stations and Industries
    Targets which have sustained damage will have the amount of damage 
reduced during the Computer Overnight Activity Phase. The amount of damage 
repaired depends on the target type: roughly 4% per day for industries, 10% 
per day for airfields, and 12% per day for radar stations. The repair rate is 
highly variable for radar stations, and fairly predictable for airfields and 
industries.

12.0 PILOT REPLACEMENTS

    Pilots who are lost in combat are replaced from a reserve pool of pilots. 
The number of replacement pilots available is different for each aircraft 
type, and is essentially proportional to the number of aircraft of that type 
at the beginning of the game. The pilot replacement rate is about 80% of the 
new aircraft production rate for most aircraft types. This means that it is  
more difficult to replace pilot losses, than aircraft losses  The British 
will usually feel the effect of any pilot shortage more rapidly than the 
Germans, since they start with fewer extra pilots in each unit. Replacement 
pilots are assigned automatically to the units which have the lowest ratio of 
pilots to aircraft.

13.0 UNIT QUALITY

13.1 Experience
    Experience represents the average amount of exposure to combat by the 
pilots in a unit. This is a number from 0 to 9, with 0 representing no 
experience, and 9 a highly veteran unit. At the start of the fighter Command 
time period, the German fighter units have the most experience, followed by 
the British Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons. A unit will undergo a 
fractional increase in experience each time it engages an enemy unit (only if 
friendly unit has an experience level under 5) and/or destroys an enemy 
aircraft and a fractional decrease in experience whenever a new pilot is  
assigned to the unit.
13.2 Morale
    Morale is a subjective measure of the attitude or spirit of a unit, 
represented by values from 0 (low) to 9 (high). Morale will be affected 
positively by shooting down enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage on a 
target, being assigned to the 2-hour call (or to a lesser extent 30-minute 
alert) readiness state, or having a day off from combat. Negative morale 
changes are the result of combat losses, flying missions (including transfer 
missions), bombing of a squadron's home base (irrespective of whether the 
squadron is on the base at the time of the bombing), or remaining at a high 
readiness state for extended periods of time. A units morale will never rise 
above 6.0 from resting (ie, success in combat is the only way to raise morale 
over 6).
13.3 Effects of Unit Experience and Morale
    Units with higher morale and experience will be more accurate with their 
bombs, and will be more successful in dogfights. Units with morale under 3 
will have a much greater chance of being unable to locate the enemy. Note a 
squadron with E/M of 5/5 will be much more effective than a squadron with E/M 
of 9/1 or 1/9.

14.0 UNIT AVAILABILITY

14.1 Readiness
    British squadrons can be assigned to any of 5 readiness states, which 
represent the time required before they can take off to intercept a German 
raid. Readiness can be assigned either on a default basis for a Group or an 
airfield, or for an individual unit.
    The highest readiness state is  RUNWAY ALERT, where pilots are in their 
planes on the runway with the engines running. This is the only readiness  
state from which aircraft on the ground will automatically take off and avoid 
damage if their base is attacked. The maximum time a unit can be in this 
state is two hours. When this  maximum time is reached, the unit will be 
unavailable for 20-40 minutes while refueling, and then will return to its 
Group's assigned readiness state.
    COCKPIT ALERT is the next highest readiness state. The entire squadron 
can be in the air in 4 minutes from this alert condition. Assigning a unit to 
either Cockpit or Runway Alert will lower the morale of the unit (Runway 
alert will cause a greater reduction in morale than Cockpit Alert).
    The intermediate readiness condition is HUT ALERT. The time required to 
take-off is 8 minutes. A unit can remain in this readiness state indefinitely 
with no positive or negative morale effects.
     As the name implies, it takes 30 minutes for a squadron to respond to an 
order if it is in the 30-MINUTE AlERT state. If a unit is not assigned to a 
higher alert state during the day, it will have a slight morale increase.
     The least responsive readiness condition is 2-HOUR CAll. Units which are 
in this condition receive an increase in morale if they remain in it for the 
entire day.
14.2 Endurance
     Each aircraft type has a maximum time that it can remain in the air. 
This  endurance time affects both the distance German aircraft can fly in 
reaching their targets, and the amount of time a British squadron can remain 
on patrol or searching for a raid. Endurance values are shown in the data 
presented for each aircraft type. The units most affected by limited 
endurance are the German ME-109E fighters and JU-87B Stuka dive bombers. 
These units usually can only conduct raids about as far away as London. 
Larger raids, and raids at higher altitudes spend more time in the assembly 
area, and thus reduce the distance which limited endurance aircraft can 
cover. The maximum range shown on the map assumes small raids at low 
altitude.
14.3 Refueling
     When British aircraft return from a mission they must spend 20-40 
minutes on the ground refueling before being able to return to action    
(determined at random).

15.0 WEATHER

15.1 Weather Generation and Prediction
     Weather is expressed in terms of percentage of cloud cover. The actual 
cloud cover percentage is assigned using a procedure which insures having at 
least 3 days of relatively good weather and at least 2 days of relatively 
poor weather each week. Fair to good weather also is insured for the first 
and last day of each scenario.
     Weather forecasts provided to the players are estimates of the actual 
cloud cover percentage, and can be in error by as much as 30 percent. The 
forecasts given to the British player are usually more accurate than those 
given to the German player.
15.2 Weather Effects
     The cloud cover percentage significantly affects the likelihood that a 
German raid will be able to find and bomb its assigned target(s). Similarly, 
the probability that a patrolling or intercepting British squadron will spot 
a German raid depends on the percent of cloud cover. Non-combat aircraft 
losses also are much more likely when missions are flown in poor weather.

16.0 SCENARIO DESCRIPTIONS

16.1 Campaign (13 August - 15 September 1940)
    This scenario covers the 34-day period from Eagle Day on 13 August 
through the climactic great air battle on 15 September, celebrated as Battle 
of Britain day in England.
16.2 Phase I (13 August - 23 August 1940)
    The Phase I scenario covers the critical opening week and one-half of the 
battle. The Germans primary targets during this phase were the radar stations 
and RAF airfields.
16.3 Phase II (24 August - 6 September 1940)
    The middle 2 weeks of the battle are covered in Phase II. The intensity 
of the German raids was least during this phase of the actual battle, partly 
due to poor weather. The primary targets during this phase were the RAF 
sector airfields.
16.4 Phase III (7 September - 15 September 1940)
     The principal German target during the final week of the battle was 
London. Operations orders issued early in September also ordered Luftwaffe 
units to begin concentrating attacks on British aircraft factories.
16.5 Eagle Day (13 August 1940)
    The start of the German air offensive against Britain was given the code 
name Adlertag, or Eagle Day. The two principal targets for this day were 
radar stations and airfields. However, because of faulty intelligence, 
several of the airfields the Germans actually attacked this day were Bomber 
and Coastal Command fields, and not fighter Command's. This scenario, 
introductory in nature, is intended to produce an all-out assault by the 
Germans.

17.0 VICTORY CONDITIONS

    The Germans have the obligation to initiate attacks in Fighter Command, 
and the victory conditions reflect the necessity for the Germans to achieve 
certain objectives. The British players role is to prevent the German player 
(or the computer) from achieving these objectives.
    Victory points are used to quantify the degree to which the German player 
is able to achieve each of his objectives in the multi-day scenarios (all 
except Eagle Day), victory points are awarded for the following damage to 
each of the 3 target types , difference in Luftwaffe average morale and 
fighter Command average morale, ratio of German fighters to British fighters, 
British aircraft losses, and forcing the British player to pull back from 
basing any units in the three closest airfields (Manston. Lympne and 
Hawkinge). The German player loses points for German aircraft losses, and if 
the fighter ratio favors the British. The victory points associated with each 
item in each scenario are shown in the table on the next page. It also 
indicates the levels of victory associated with different victory point 
totals.

  Victory points are awarded during the day for each of the following:

18.0 STRATEGY NOTES

18.1 German Player
1. A good general rule to follow in assigning raids is to use at least as 
many escorting fighters as you have bombers. The farther into England the 
raid must go, the more fighters you need (and remember the ME-109 endurance 
limit).
2. Use your elite units carefully. Their initial high experience and morale 
levels afford them a distinct advantage. 
3. If your bomber losses are running too high, put more escorts with each 
raid, and assign more of them to the Close escort tactic. If fighter losses  
are too high, assign more escorts to the High escort tactic. 
4. It is usually a good idea to concentrate your attacks in both time and 
area, ie, saturate the British defenses. Use offset approach points to bring  
all raids in along the same path as much as possible.
5. A good strategy to follow is to make initial attacks against radars so 
that they won t be able to detect subsequent raids. Attack airfields after 
other targets, in the hope of catching more aircraft on the ground refueling.
6. It is generally best to attack radars at low altitude (below 1000 feet), 
airfields between 1 and 5 thousand feet, and cities above 5 thousand feet.
7. Don't fly many raids when the weather gets bad. There is too much chance 
of the target being obscured by clouds, and operational losses go up in bad 
weather.
18.2 British Player
1. Avoid demoralizing units unnecessarily by keeping too many of them 
assigned to high readiness states for too long. Give units with low morale 
the day off occasionally, or send them to 13 Group to rest up for a few days.
2. Use patrols to help screen against hit-and-run attacks on the radar 
stations and airfields located closest to France. They also can be used to 
fill in detection gaps caused by damaged radar stations, and to protect 
airfields where several squadrons are refueling.
3. Move your squadrons around occasionally so the German player doesn't 
know which airfields are in use.
4. Avoid over-committing your interceptors to the first two or three raids.  
Some of these could be feints, and there could be many more raids coming.
5. Use your less capable aircraft to attack deep penetration raids, or 
raids which have been attacked several times already by Spitfires or 
Hurricanes.

HISTORICAL NOTES

BACKGROUND
     In the summer of 1940, the German armed forces were recovering from 
their victorious battle for France in the West, only Great Britain, whose 
army had lost nearly all its equipment at Dunkirk, still resisted. ln fact, 
the British position was so hopeless the Germans expected them to accept a 
peace settlement, leaving Germany in control of the continent and in position 
to deal with their real perceived enemy, the Soviet Union. When the British, 
led, and encouraged by Winston Churchill, refused all German peace offers the 
German armed forces prepared for an invasion of the British Isles as the only 
way of finally subduing Britain.
     As it had for centuries, the Royal Navy stood between Britain and its 
continental enemy. Since Germany could not hope to match British sea power in 
the channel, their only hope for a successful invasion lay in complete 
control of the air. If the Royal Air force could be decisively defeated, the 
Luftwaffe could insure the success of the planned invasion of Britain.
LUFTWAFFE
    As the Luftwaffe fighter and bomber Geschwaders established themselves on 
their newly won airfields on the french coast, they constituted what was 
undoubtedly the most powerful air force in the world. Losses over France and 
the Low Countries had been light and the Luftwaffe, under its arrogant and 
boisterous leader Hermann Goering, was prepared to deal the Royal Air Force 
the same quick defeat it had administered upon every other air force they had 
opposed.
     While Goering provided more show than leadership, the Luftwaffe 
possessed ample strategic and tactical talent in men like Chief of the Air 
Staff, General Major Hans Jeschonnek and the commander of Luftflotte 2, 
General der Fleiger Albert Kesselring. Thanks to combat experience gained 
over Spain, Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands. and France, Luftwaffe 
aircrews, and particularly the fighter pilots, were the most skilled and 
capable combat fliers in the world. The German combat aircraft, tested in 
combat, had proven superior to anything it had faced. Surely, it would do so 
again against the Royal Air Force
     ME-109E.  The "Emil", as it was affectionately called by its pilots, was  
the universal single seat/single engine fighter of the Jagdgeschawaders as 
they entered the Battle of Britain. lt was fast, maneuverable, and well 
armed. It was clearly superior to any British fighter, with the exception of 
the Spitfire, which was pretty much its equal below 20,000 ft. The 109 had 
but one major flaw - it lacked range. This had not been significant over the 
continent. It would prove fatal in the Battle of Britain.
     ME-110C. The Me-110 was the long-range escort and strike fighter of the 
Luftwaffe. It possessed the range capability which the Me-109 lacked. lt was 
fast, well armed, and against the French and Poles, had proven very capable. 
Over Britain, however, its lack of maneuverability and its sluggish 
acceleration would make it no match for the British single-seat fighters.  
The inability of the Me-110 to perform its long-range escort duties  
effectively over Britain would prove to be one of the decisive factors in the 
Battle Of Britain.
HE-111H. To the British civilian, the He-111H, with the dull throbbing of its 
unsynchronized engines and its unmistakable silhouette, personified the 
"Jerry Blitz" better than any other German warplane. The 111 could carry an 
adequate bombload to any target in Britain, and conducted some highly 
successful attacks, including raids on Bristol and the Spitfire works in 
Southampton in September. However, it lacked the firepower or robustness  to 
defend itself against the British 8-gun fighters and, if caught unescorted by 
109s, its formations were often decimated.
     DO-17Z. The Dornier DO-17Z was known as the flying pencil due to its 
extremely slim fuselage. It shared, with the HE-111, the major medium bomber 
duties in the Battle of Britain and, while somewhat faster, also shared the 
Heinkel's vulnerability to fighter attack if unescorted. The Dornier flew 
many hundreds of sorties over Britain during the summer of 1940. and its  
derivatives served actively throughout the war.
     JU-87B. Throughout the series of German successes in Europe in 1939 and 
1940, the JU-87 "Stuka" established a reputation as a supremely effective 
aerial weapon. However, against the aggressive fighter encountered over 
southern England, the slow speed and inadequate armament of the JU-87 led to 
disastrous losses. The Stuka was quickly limited to channel and coastal 
operations only, and then withdrawn from the battle altogether.
      JU-88A. Of the several bomber types employed over Britain, the JU-88 
was, by far, the finest. While vulnerable to fighter attack when unescorted 
as were all bombers of the time period, the JU-88 was fast and maneuverable 
enough to make effective interception difficult for spitfires and Hurricanes, 
and nearly impossible for Blenheims, Gladiators, or Defiants. The aircraft's 
most spectacular accomplishment over Britain occurred on the evening of 16 
August when two JU-88 s came in low and fast over an RAF training field and 
destroyed or damaged 63 aircraft, including 11 Hurricanes. One measure of the 
success of the JU-88 is the fact that it would eventually be built in greater 
numbers than all other German bomber types combined
ROYAL AIR FORCE
     After withdrawing from France, including nearly two weeks of constant 
combat over Dunkirk, the RAF prepared to meet the Germans over Britain its 
elf. RAF Fighter Command was badly outnumbered, most of its fighters were 
significantly inferior to the ME-109, and its  pilots lacked the combat 
experience of their German counterparts. Fighter Command did enjoy several 
advantages of its own, however. The British pilots would be flying over their 
own country, they would be guided and controlled by the best air defense 
system in the world, and their spirit, dedication, and courage was  
unsurpassed.
     Perhaps as significant as any advantage possessed by Fighter Command was 
the strategic insight possessed by its commander, Air Vice Marshal Sir Hugh 
Dowding. He realized that to win the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe had to 
gain control of the air over Southern England and the Channel. Fighter 
Command, on the other hand, had only to survive. Time alone would tell which 
way the scales of victory would tip, and it would be, in the end, by the 
narrowest of margins.
     SPITFIRE I. The Spitfire I was the first aircraft capable of meeting the 
German ME-109 on an equal basis. It often took on the escorting fighters 
while the Hurricanes went after the bombers. Flown by skillful and 
experienced pilots like Doug Bader, Al Deere or Johnnie Johnson, the Spitfire 
was indeed deadly.
     HURRICANE I. ln the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane constituted 
approximately 60% of Fighter Command strength, and accounted for more enemy 
aircraft than any other type. The Hurricane was at a definite disadvantage 
against the ME-109, which was significantly faster, but it held its own on 
many occasions. Moreover, it was  an excellent bomber interceptor and, if 
given an altitude advantage, could decimate a bomber formation quickly with 
its eight wing-mounted 
machine guns. The Hurricane, although not an 
outstanding performer, was there in numbers when the RAF needed it 
desperately.
      DEFIANT. The Defiant was the first fighter in the world to incorporate 
a power-driven gun turret as its major armament. It achieved considerable 
initial success over Dunkirk, when German fighters wouLd "bounce" it as they 
would a conventional fighter and thereby walk right into the considerable 
firepower of the dorsal turret The Luftwaffe fighter pilots learned quickIy, 
however, and began to attack the vulnerable underbelly of the Defiant, whose 
performance was  considerably penalized by the weight of the turret and 
second crewman. The Defiant was withdrawn from regular day combat in late 
July when a formation of six was decimated by a flight of Messerschmitts       
      GLADIATOR. The GIadiator was the last biplane fighter to serve in the 
RAF. It was totally unsuited for interceptor duties against the fast and well 
escorted German formations, and was an easy victim for the ME-109.
      BLENHEIM I. The Blenheim was a light bomber whose speed was superior to 
the pre-war fighters which were its contemporaries. For that reason, it was  
given a fixed forward firing armament and pressed into service as a fighter. 
Under the right circumstances, it could deal with an unescorted bomber 
formation but, if caught by escorting fighters - even the usually inept 
ME-110 - it was in for a bad time.

THE ACTUAL BATTLE
    The long-anticipated Eagle Day, the start of the Luftwaffe aerial assault 
on Britain, actually opened with a series of blunders. The weather was not 
the best, so the attack was ordered delayed. But some units didn't get the 
word, and in the confusion which resulted the Germans eventually managed to 
mount only 1500 sorties, losing 45 aircraft to the British loss of 13.
    The attack tempo remained heavy throughout the first week, with the 
Germans twice losing more than 70 aircraft in a single day, and British 
losses reaching 34 planes destroyed in one day, on 15 August. The major 
German targets were the radar stations and airfields. Fortunately for the 
British, the Germans did not concentrate their attacks strictly on Fighter 
Command fields, thus  sparing these hard-pressed facilities from the brunt of 
the intitial attacks.
     British tactical doctrine during this period was to make defense of     
the sector airfields their top priority, and to have all interceptors go 
after the bombers, avoiding combat with the German fighters whenever 
possible.
     During the second phase of the Battle, the Germans began to focus their 
attention almost exclusively on the 11 Group sector airfields. By the        
first of September, these raids were beginning to have devastating effects.  
Six of the seven 11 Group sector fields were heavily damaged, and the British 
were losing about twice as many aircraft as they were receiving. Their pilot 
total was reduced almost 25%, and British morale was  declining rapidly. 
German intelligence reports began to indicate that the British had very few 
operational fighters remaining.
      But with victory apparently within their grasp, the Germans began  
shifting targets to the aircraft factories, and to London. Granted an 
unexpected respite from the steady pounding they had been taking, the sector 
airfields soon were back in business. London, on the other hand, was heavily 
hit for the first time on 7 September. Most of the German bombers sent to 
attack London on 9 September were turned back by vigorous British opposition, 
but a more determined attack on 11 September caused extensive damage. The 
Spitfire factory at Southampton was also badly damaged this same day, and the 
British lost more aircraft than the Germans for one of the few times during 
the Battle. Things were again Looking bleak for the British.
    On Sunday, 15 September, the final decisive daylight battle was fought. 
Almost 1,0000 German sorties were flown, and 60 aircraft failed to return. In 
the face of such a high loss rate, Hitler two days later ordered OperatIon 
Sea Lion, the planned invasion of England, to be postponed until further 
notice, and the Battle of Britain was, in essence, declared lost by the 
Germans.
