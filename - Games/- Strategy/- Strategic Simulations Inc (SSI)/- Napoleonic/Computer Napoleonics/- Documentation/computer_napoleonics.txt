1.0  INTRODUCTION
=================

1.1  Description of Play
------------------------
Computer Napoleonics: The Battle of Waterloo is a division level simulation of
the battle of Waterloo, the decisive final encounter between the Allied Armies
of England and Prussia and the French Armee Du Nord.  The battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon Bonaparte's last battle, took place on Jun 18, 1815.  Computer
Napoleonics is both a two-player and solitaire game.  One player commands the
forces of Napoleon while the other player (or the computer) commands the
forces of Anglo-Allied-Prussian armies.  The players take turns moving their
units and engaging in combat.  The outcome of each individual engagement is
determined by the computer in accordance with the probabilities given in the
Combat Results Tale.  Play continues in this fashion for ten game turns or
until one side has successfully fulfilled its victory conditions.

The game map displayed on the video screen is divided into bricks (referred to
as squares) in order to regulate movement and combat.  Each square represents
400 meters of terrain, while each combat unit represents artillery, cavalry or
infantry formations of approximately division size.  Each game turn represents
one hour of real time.

1.2  Talking to the Computer
----------------------------
Whenever entering a command to the computer complete your command by pressing
the 'return' key (often referred to the symbol (CR) which stands for carriage
return).  To correct a mistake use the 'back arrow' key to go backwards, then
type over the mistake.

1.3  Saving a Game
------------------
Upon completion of each player's combat execution phase the computer will
allow the player(s) to save the game in progress.  If you choose to save the
game you will need a scratch disc to store the data.  Once the game is saved
you will be able to restart it from the point at which you left off.

1.4  Mapboard coordinates
------------------------
To identify a particular square on the map, first read the row number and then
the column number.  For example, Hougomont is located in square 5861.  The row
numbers are located on the left-hand side of the maps, while the column numbers
are located around the top, bottom and right-hand sides of the maps.

1.5  Starting a Game
--------------------
To begin a game, boot your disc and the game will begin automatically.


2.0  GENERAL DESCRIPTION
========================

2.1  Parts Inventory
--------------------
A) Game Box
B) Rule Book
C) 5 1/4" Game Disc
D) Two Mapboard Charts
E) Two Game Information Cards

2.2  Definition of Terms
------------------------
2.21 Movement Allowance:  The maximum number of squares which a unit may be
     moved in a single movement phase, expressed in Movement Points.

2.22 Combat Strength: The relative strength of a unit with regard to attack
     and defense, expressed in terms of Strength Points.

2.3  Mapboard Codes
-------------------
2.31 General: The game represents the actual ground in Belgium over which the
     Battle of Waterloo was fought.  The entire map consists of 20 horizontal
     rows and 18 diagonal columns and is accurately represented on two
     mapboards.

2.32 Terrain:  There are four types of terrain - woods, clear, village, and
     chateau.  Terrain affects the movement and combat strength of units as
     per the Terrain Effects Chart.  There is actually a fifth type of terrain
     (crest) that has no effect on the game.  Crests are shown as lines on the
     mapboard and represent the tops of the many hills that were on the
     battlefield.  Crests do no affect movement or combat and are included
     only for historical interest.

2.33 Combat Units:  Each unit is represented by a two-letter identification; the
     first letter indicates the unit type (i.e., Artillery, Cavalry or
     Infantry) and nationality (i.e., Allied or French) and the second letter
     indicates the relative unit strength.

2.34 Unit Type:  A = Allied Artillery  C = Allied Cavalry  I = Allied Infantry
     a = French Artillery   c = French Cavalry  i = French Infantry

2.35 Unit Strength:  Each unit is assigned a relative combat strength which is
     listed on the unit roster.

2.36 Unit Roster:  The roster lists each player's units by ID code, strength
     points, movement points, starting square (and turn of arrival if the unit
     is a reinforcement), and historical designation.


3.0  SEQUENCE OF PLAY
=====================
The game is played in a series of game turns each consisting of a French
player turn and an Allied player turn.  Each game turn represents the passage
of one hour.

3.1  French Player Turn
-----------------------
The French player is always the first player to move an engage in combat.  The
French player turn is broken into three parts, the French movement phase, the
French combat set-up phase, and the French combat resolution phase.

3.11 French Movement Phase: The player commanding the French army moves each
     of his units on the mapboard in any order he chooses, within the
     limitations imposed by Movement rules.  As orders are given, the computer
     moves each unit into its new position.  A player may cancel the orders
     given to the a particular unit by entering a move command after which the
     unit will be returned to its original starting position and new movement
     orders may be given.  When the French player is satisfied with his moves,
     enters the appropriate command to end the Movement Phase.

3.12 French Combat Set-up Phase: The French player must now attack all enemy
     units which are adjacent to any French units.  Combat is mandatory.  The
     French player enters combat orders for each of his units participating in
     combat (i.e., any units which are adjacent to an enemy unit plus any
     artillery units which are in range and which the French player wishes to
     use).

3.2  Save Game Phase:
---------------------
The player(s) may save the game and/or continue.

3.3  Allied Player Turn
-----------------------
The Allied player (or the computer) now moves his units and engages in combat
in the same fashion as the French player.

3.31 Allied Movement Phase: The Allied player (or the computer) moves each of
     his units in the same manner as the French moved the French army.

3.32 Allied Combat Set-up Phase: The Allied player (or the computer) declares
     his attacks to the computer.

3.33 Allied Combat Resolution Phase: The Allied player (or the computer)
     resolves all combat previously set up.

3.4  Save Game Phase
--------------------
Once again the player(s) may save the game and/or continue.

3.5 Repeat steps 3.1 - 3.4 until ten complete game turns have been played or
until a winner is declared (whichever comes first).


4.0  GENERAL COMMANDS
=====================
Commands are divided into two general categories: movement commands and combat
commands.

4.1  Movement Commands
----------------------
4.11 Initial Computer Query:

      "ENTER ID OF UNIT YOU WISH TO MOVE-"

      Possible player responses:
          xx - Move unit with ID xx.
          FX - List the French units that have exited the map
          NM - New Map
          DM - Done moving

4.12 Initial Computer Query:

      "MP'S LEFT=n. ENTER MOVE-"

     Possible player responses:

          d - Move the unit one square in direction d.
          'return' (also known as CR) - End the move of the unit currently
                                        moving.
          Mdd...d - Move the unit one square in each direction listed in the
                    order that the directions are listed and then end that
                    unit's move.

4.2  Combat Commands
--------------------

4.21 Initial Computer Query:

      "ENTER ID OF UNIT YOU WISH TO ATTACK-"

     Possible player responses:
          xx - Attack the enemy unit with ID xx.
          ?xx - List units attacking unit xx.
          Mxxyyyy...yy - Conduct multiple attack of unit xx with units
                         yyyy...yy.
          VV - Print in inverse video the ID's of enemy units which must be
               attacked.
          NM - New Map
          DA - Done attacking
  
4.22 Initial Computer Query:

      "ENTER ID OF AN ATTACKING UNIT-"

     Possible player responses:
          xx - Attack with unit xx.
          Rxx - Remove unit xx from attack.
          Q - Quit attacking the unit.

4.23 Initial Computer Query:

      "WHICH ENEMY UNIT DO YOU WISH TO RESOLVE COMBAT FOR-"

     Possible player responses:
          xx - Resolve combat against unit xx.
          NM - New Map
          Auto - automatically resolve all remaining combats and end
                 the combat and execution phase.

4.3  Examples of the Use of Movement Orders
-------------------------------------------

4.31 For the French to move unit ie from square 6463 to square 6365 on the
     first turn the French player may enter one of the two following sets of
     commands during the French movement phase:

    A) ie(CR) 2(CR) 2(CR) 1(CR) (CR).  This will move unit ie in direction 2
       for two squares and then in direction 1 for one square with a movement
       of each square occurring after each (CR).

    B) ie(CR) M221(CR). This will also result in a move of two squares in
       direction 2 and then a move of one square in direction 1.  This is a
       shortcut way of moving units if you know in advance where you wish them
       to move.

4.4  Examples of the Use of Combat Commands
-------------------------------------------

4.41  Assume unit cg is in square 6767, unit ij is in square 6667, unit ae is
      in square 6766, and unit IO is in square 6768.  If the French wished to
      attack unit IO with units cg, ij, ae then he may enter one of the
      following sets of commands during the French combat set-up phase.

     A) IO(CR) cg(CR) ij(CR) ae(CR) Q(CR).

     B) MIOcgijae(CR).

4.42 Now let's assume the French player has set up the attack on unit IO but
     decides to use unit ae for another attack.  To remove unit ae from the
     attack on IO enter the following:

     IO(CR) Rae(CR).

4.5 IMPORTANT - REMEMBER THAT THE (CR) IS A SYMBOL USED TO REPRESENT THE APPLE
    'return' KEY.


5.0  MOVEMENT
=============
During each movement phase the phasing player may move any, all or none of his
units.  Units may be moved in any direction or combination of directions.  A
given unit's movement, however, is always restricted y the unit's Movement
Points, as well as y restrictions imposed y terrain and other movement rules.

5.1  Movement Restrictions
--------------------------

5.11 Movement Points: Movement is calculated in terms of Movement Points.  The
     number of Movement Points expended by a unit during movement during a
     single Movement Phase may not exceed its total Movement Allowance.

5.12 The Movement Allowance of various units is as follows:
     Artillery - 3 Movement Points
     Infantry - 4 Movement Points
     Cavalry and Horse Artillery - 5 Movement Points

5.13 A unit may expend any portion of its Movement Allowance, but unused
     Movement Points may not be accumulated from one Movement Phase to the
     next or transferred from on unit to another.

5.14 A unit expends one movement point to enter a Clear, Village or Chateau
     square.

5.15 Woods squares are impassable; units are never allowed to enter a woods
     square.

5.2  Zones of Control
---------------------
The six squares immediately adjacent to a square constitute the zones of
control of any unit in that square.  Squares upon which a unit exerts a zone of
control are called controlled squares and inhibit the movement of enemy units.
All units must cease movement when they enter an enemy controlled square.

          ³         ³         ³         ³         ³         ³
          ÀÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÙ
               ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³
               ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³
          ÚÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄ¿
          ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³  Unit   ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³
          ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³
          ÀÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÙ
               ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³
               ³         ³ xxxxxxx ³ xxxxxxx ³         ³

          ³         ³         ³         ³         ³         ³

5.21 All units exert zones of control throughout the game turn.  Zones of
     control are never negated by units, enemy or friendly.

5.22 Units do not pay any additional movement points to enter an enemy
     controlled square.

5.23 Units may only leave a zone of control as a result of combat.  Units may
     never move out of an enemy zone of control during a movement phase.

5.24 Zone of control are mutual, i.e. if a given unit is in an
     enemy-controlled square, the enemy unit is likewise in its controlled
     square. Thus units are locked into combat with each other.

5.25 Friendly zones of control never inhibit the movement of friendly units.  There is
     no additional cost for entering a friendly controlled or occupied square.

5.3  Although friendly units may move through squares containing other
     friendly units, two units may never end a phase in the same square.

5.4  For the purposes of issuing movement commands, the various directions
     which a unit may move are assigned the following designations:

                    ÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄ-
                         ³   6     ³    1    ³
                         ³     \   ³   /     ³
                    ÚÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄ¿
                    ³     5__ ³  Unit   ³ __2     ³
                    ³         ³         ³         ³
                    ÀÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÙ
                         ³     /   ³   \     ³
                         ³   4     ³    3    ³
                    ÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄ

5.5  Only French units may move off the map.  Units may only leave the right
     map edge between squares 5168 and 5871 (see section 10.1).

5.6  French units may not lock Allied reinforcements.  Thus French units may
     never enter a square in row 70.


6.0  COMBAT
===========

6.1  Combat Set-up Rules
------------------------
Combat between adjacent opposing units is mandatory.  Artillery units are the
only units which may attack units to which they are not adjacent (see section
section 7.0).  The layer who has just completed moving is termed the Attacker;
the other player is the Defender, regardless of the overall situation.

6.2  Which Units Attack
-----------------------

6.21 All units which end the movement phase in an enemy-controlled square must
     attack at least one enemy unit during the combat phase.  Exception: The
     units in Hougomont and La Haye Sainte at the beginning of the game are
     never forced to attack (see section 8.0).

6.22 All enemy units that have friendly units in their zones of control must
     be attacked by at least one unit during the combat phase.

6.23 The Attacker may choose which attacking units will attack each defending
     unit, as long as all adjacent friendly units participate in an attack and
     so long as all adjacent enemy units are attacked.

6.24 An Enemy unit may be attacked by up to six friendly units.

6.25 No unit may attack more than once per combat phase (although it may
     attack more than one unit) and no enemy unit may e attacked more than
     once per combat phase.  Units may only attack a unit to which they are
     adjacent (exception; see section 7.0)

6.3  Multi-Unit Combat
----------------------

6.31 If a unit is in the zone of control of more than one enemy unit, it must
     attack all of those units which are not being attacked by some other
     friendly unit.

6.32 Units in two or more different squares may combine their attack against a
     single adjacent enemy unit.

6.33 A single unit's combat strength may never be divided among different
     combats during the same combat phase.

6.34 A single attacking unit may attack more that one enemy unit in one
     attack.

6.35 A single defending unit may be attacked by more than one attacking unit
     in one combat.

6.36 If a friendly unit is attacking more than one enemy unit then no other
     friend;y unit may attack those units (i.e., 1 unit attacking 2 units is
     legal, but 2 units attacking 3 units is not legal).

6.4  Units defending in certain types of terrain may have their combat
     strength increased.  Units in village or chateau hexes have their combat
     strength doubled (2X) when defending.

6.5  Combat Resolution Procedure
--------------------------------
After the attacker has allocated his attacks and issued his orders, the
computer resolves each attack in order of the attacker's choice.  The computer
automatically compares the total combined strength of the attacking units to
the strength of the defending units in order to arrive at a combat ratio (3 to
1, 1 to 2, etc.).  The ratio is always rounded down in favor of the defender.
The computer then obtains a random number between zero and nine and consults
the combat results table to arrive at a result.

6.6  Explanation of Combat Results:
-----------------------------------

  AR - (Attacker Retreats) - All attacking units must move back one square.
        (The first unit retreated is the first unit selected as an attacker,
        the second unit is the second unit selected as an attacker, etc).
  DR - (Defender Retreats) - All defending units must move back one square
  AE - (Attacker Eliminated) - All attacking units are destroyed and removed
        from the game.
  DE - (Defender Eliminated) - All defending units are destroyed and removed
        from the game.
  EX - (Exchange) - All defending units are eliminated.  The attacker must
        lose at least an equal number of strength points from among the units
        which participated in the attack and which are adjacent to the
        defender. Since whole units must be lost, the attacker may lose more
        strength points than the defender.  The computer eliminates the first
        attacking unit that was ordered to attack, and then the second, etc.,
        until enough attacking strength points have been eliminated to satisfy
        the exchange.

6.7  A unit that is forced to retreat as a result of combat will automatically
     be retreated one square by the computer.  Units may not retreat into a
     square they would normally be unable to move into (woods, row 70 for the
     French), nor may a unit retreat into an enemy-controlled square.  Units
     may not retreat off the map or onto another friendly unit.  If a
     retreating unit has not square to retreat to, it is eliminated.  Allied
     units will be retreated in direction 1 if possible.  If direction 1 is
     blocked they will retreat in directions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in that order of
     preference. French units will be retreated in direction 4 if possible.
     If direction 4 is blocked they will retreat in directions 5, 6, 1, 2, 3
     in that order of preference.

6.8  Whenever, as a direct result of combat, a defending unit is retreated or
     eliminated, the attacking player may advance one of his surviving
     adjacent units (which participated in that attack) into the square
     formerly occupied by that enemy unit.  This option must be exercised
     immediately.  The advance may be made even if the advancing unit is still
     in another enemy's zone of control.

6.9  Retreating and advancing as a result of combat is not considered regular
     movement and is not counted as an expenditure of movement points.


7.0  ARTILLERY
==============

7.1  General
------------
Unlike infantry and cavalry units, artillery units may participate in attacks
against units to which they are not adjacent.  This is called bombarding.  An
artillery unit may bombard a unit from a two square distance.  However,
artillery units must participate in normal combat when adjacent to opposing
units.

7.2  Artillery units may attack non-adjacent enemy units that are two squares
     distant (but no more).  They are not forced to attack any units in this
     manner.

7.3  Range from the artillery unit is calculated y including the target
     square, but not the bombarding unit's square.

7.4  Artillery units may only attack a single enemy unit when bombarding.

7.5  Artillery attacking from a non-adjacent square, i.e. bombarding, suffer
     no adverse combat results; they are never eliminated or retreated as a
     result of their own attack.

7.6  Artillery unit may not bombard over a woods square.

7.7  Artillery units fire over other units, enemy and friendly.

7.8  Adjacent Attacks
---------------------
When an artillery unit is in an enemy-controlled square it may not bombard and
must participate in normal combat as would any other unit.

7.9  An artillery unit may never add its combat strength to another unit's
     defensive value by bombardment.  An artillery unit may only bombard
     during its own combat phase.


8.0  CHATEAU GARRISON UNITS
===========================
The two chateau garrison units (Hougomont-IR and La Haye Sainte-IS) are
affected by special rules.

8.1  Movement
-------------
Neither unit may move.

8.2 Combat
----------
Neither unit may attack nor are they ever forced to attack.  Also if either
unit is forced to retreat it is eliminated.


9.0  REINFORCEMENTS
===================
The Allied player receives Prussian reinforcements during the Allied movement
phase of turns three, four, five, and six.  These units are automatically
placed on the mapboard at the beginning of the movement phase and may be moved
normally once on the map.  Since French units may not enter row 70 the
reinforcements will always appear if thee are no Allied units in squares 7072
to 7075.  If any Allied unit is in square 7072, 7073, 7074, or 7075 then all
of the future Prussian reinforcements are delayed one turn.


10.0  VICTORY CONDITIONS
========================

10.1  French Victory
--------------------
The French player wins if his army destroys 50 Allied strength points and
exits any seven of his units off the right map edge between hexes 5168 and
5871.

10.2  Allied Victory
--------------------
The Allied player wins if his army destroys 50 French strength points before
the French have destroyed 50 Allied strength points.

10.3  The game is declared a draw if neither player succeeds in fulfilling his
      victory conditions by the end of the tenth game turn.

10.4  Allied Demoralization
---------------------------
If the French have destroyed 50 Allied strength points ut have not yet exited
seven units off the map then the Allied units are considered to be
demoralized.  The effect this has on the game is to shift the combat ratio one
column in favor of the French. Examples: A French attack of 1 to 1 against a
demoralized Allied unit would become 2 to 1.  An Allied attack of 3 to 1 would
become 2 to 1.


11.0  SOLITAIRE
===============
In the solitaire game the computer commands the Anglo-Allied armies.  In the
solitaire game, in order to provide the player with a greater challenge, it is
necessary for the French player to eliminate 60 Allied strength points in
order to cause demoralization and in order to win the game (instead of the 50
required in the two-player game).


12.0  DESIGNER's NOTES:
=======================
This game was designed to be an introductory type wargame.  The two major
design criteria were that the game play fast (1 evening) and be as simple as
possible while still giving the players the feel of the battle of Waterloo.
The biggest problem came from the fact Chateaus offered excellent defensive
positions for small groups of soldiers (Napoleon never took Hougomont).  The
decision to create another type of unit (garrison) does detract from the
simplicity, ut adds so much to the realism that it was deemed worthwhile.

For years I've enticed friends into wargaming by saying "How 'bout a fast basic
wargame."  Now I can add the extra enticement: "on my home computer!"

   Note: At the beginning of the first French player turn of every game,
   the player will be asked whether he wishes the computer to execute the
   designer's first move.  This is your chance to see the move the designer
   would use most often if he were playing you.  Once the move is completed,
   the game will continue normally.
