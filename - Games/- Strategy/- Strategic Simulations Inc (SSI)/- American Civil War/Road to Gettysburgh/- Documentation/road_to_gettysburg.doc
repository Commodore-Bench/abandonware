1.0 INTRODUCTION

THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG: is a corps/division level game simulating the week 
surrounding the Battle of Gettysburg. Each player will receive only limited 
knowledge of the location of his own and his enemy's troops. this will be 
achieved from the intelligence display and dispatches from subordinate 
commanders. During a game each player is given a unit representing the army 
commander and attached staff and escort. A player will only be able to exert 
immediate control over units within a 5-hex radius of the Commander unit. All 
units may only be ordered through the sending of dispatches which will be 
interpreted by the individual corps commanders(played by the computer). The 
intention is to accurately recreate the command control problems that were 
prevalent during the Civil War.

Note: Many times while playing this game, you will believe that something has 
gone wrong with the program. Although there is no way to guarantee that the 
program works 100% of the time, it is more likely that you have 
misinterpreted a rule or one of your corps commanders did something you 
didn't expect(like resting his corps when you wanted him to march to the 
sound of the guns). At first, this game will confuse and frustrate you, and 
only after several games will you begin to grasp what's happening.

1.2 Starting a Game (DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3)

To begin a game boot your game disc (insert the disc in drive one and turn on 
your computer) and the game will begin automatically. If you are using an 
Apple II with PASCAL, you must use your BASICS disc. If you are using an 
Apple III, you must first go into Apple II emulation Mode.


1.3 Saving a Game

During the Order Entry Phase, the players will be allowed to save a game in 
progress (see Menu A:). Enter the order SG and the computer will give 
appropriate instructions. If you choose to save the game, you will need a 
scratch disc to store the data. The scratch disc must be initialized for SSI 
use by following the instructions included in the program. Once the game is 
saved, you will be able to restart it from the point at which you left off.

2.0 GLOSSARY

Aggressive Rating - The relative aggressiveness of a commander ranging from 
-30 to +30;
negative ratings represent underaggressiveness, positive rating represent 
over-aggressiveness.

Battle Odds - A ratio of the combat strengths of the two opposing forces

Cavalry Corps - A corps which has no infantry or foot guns.

Combat Mode - The indication of what action a force is taking in the face of 
the enemy.

CORPS/DIVSN - The basic unit used in the game. The Union player's units are 
referred to as corps(CORPS), while the confederate units are refferred to as 
divisions(DIVSN). For simplicity, the rulebook always uses the term CORPS, 
but there no differences between CORPS and DIVSN.

Corps Morale - A rating showing a corps' fatigue and willingness to fight.

Estimated Battle Odds(EBO) - The battle odds (expressed as a ratio) that the 
commander thinks exists between the enemy and friendly forces involved (not 
including leadership ratings).

Fatigue Level - An indication of how tired a corps is. A unit's fatigue level 
= (2-total fatigue suffered).

Force - One or more corps under the primary commander's personal orders.

Infantry Corps - Any corps with infantry or foot guns in it.

Leadership Rating - The tactical ability of a commander, ranging from 1 to 9.

March Mode - the indication of the speed in which a unit is moving; modes are 
rest, normal, and force. the march mode determines the number of movement 
points a unit has available for movement.

Movement Allowance - The number of movement points a unit has to expend each 
turn.

Page 3


Movement Points(MP) - The quantification of time spent performing an action.

Secondary Army Commander - A deputy army commander whose only function is to 
coordinate and lead combat units during combat when the primary commander is 
not there.

Zone of Control(ZOC) - The area a unit can extend its influence into. This 
includes the six hexes surrounding a unit and the hex the unit occupies.


3.0 SETTING UP THE GAME

Each player in turn will define each of his corps' starting urgency and 
contact modes. The players will also number their corps as desired.

3.1 Numbering Corps

The number of a corps is very important to marching priorities. A low 
numbered corps will have the right of way over a high numbered corps. 
Therefore, to decrease traffic jams and have the desired corps at the head of 
a column, thought should go into the numbering of corps.
Note: Headquarters detachments are always number 11. Each player will be 
shown his corps, their strengths, and leaders. With this information, he will 
be asked to number each of his corps.
Note: Eff indicates average effectiveness rating of the corps.

3.2 Assigning Starting Urgency

The starting urgency is next assigned. The urgency will effect the actions of 
the corps.

3.3 Assigning Starting Contact Mode

In assigning the starting mode, it is important to realize that while a 
contact mode of Initiative (I) will increase the chance of the corps doing 
the right thing, there is a (sometimes fatal) loss in reaction time.

4.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

4.1 Reconnaissance Phase

During this phase the corps reconnoiter the hexes they occupy and those 
immediately surrounding them. Corps in patrol mode will reconnoiter in a 2 
hex range. Corps which are in an enemy ZOC and have an initiative contact 
mode will determine their combat mode.

4.2 Confederate Player Phase

4.2.1 The computer will print "Confederate Player Turn. Type Return to 
Continue" If an "X" is typed, the computer will skip to step 4.2.6.

4.2.2 The player will receive any activity reports. Activity reports report 
current positions of enemy or friendly troop concentrations. Some activity 
reports may be false.

4.2.3 The player will receive any arriving battle reports. Battle reports 
include the time of the battle, the friendly corps involved, the hex, whether 
the player's forces were attackers or attacked, estimated casualties and 
enemy exact strength before the battle.

Page 4


4.2.4 The player will receive any arriving reconnaissance reports. These 
include the time sent, the friendly corps performing the reconnaissance, the 
estimated enemy strength, and their hex.

4.2.5 The player will receive any arriving location reports. These include 
the time sent, the hex occupied, and, in some cases, the combat actions 
planned by the reporting corps. Confederate units also report any foraging 
which took place. Also, any leader casualties will be shown.

4.2.6 The player may issue any order in Menu A:. A command of "OF" will pass 
the player to Menu C: a command of "OC" will pass the player to Menu B: and a 
command of "ET" will end the player's phase. From Menu B: or Menu C: a 
command of "EX" will return the player to Menu A: From Menu B: a command of 
"OC" will pass the player to Menu B: for another corps specified by the 
player.

4.3 Union Player Phase

Identical to Confederate Player Phase except it is the Union player who is 
receiving reports and issuing orders.

4.4 Order Receipt Phase

Any corps receiving orders will read the orders. All orders previously 
received will be lost if non-immediate orders arrive, and any movement points 
currently being spent are lost. Therefore: do not continually send new orders 
to a corps. Hurrying a unit along will simply cause it to march in place. 
Instead, several turns of orders should be sent at once. Note: also, that 
sometimes corps may be a little slow to follow orders.

4.5 Execution Phase

Both players corps will be moved and battles will be fought. Corps in enemy 
ZOC's with a contact mode other than that of initiative will enter combat 
mode. This phase will last from 1/2 to 2 minutes.

4.6 Fatigue Phase

Corps which are in force march mode gain 1 fatigue point (i.e. become tired). 
Corps which are in normal march mode and have spent movement points will 
remain unchanged. Corps which were in rest march mode or spent no movement 
points will lose 1 fatigue point. Fatigue effects of actions performed at 
night cause triple fatigue(i.e. the 2100 turn fatigue update effects are 
tripled).
Note: Each game will begin with an initial fatigue phase before the first 
reconnaisance phase.

5.0 ZONES OF CONTROL

Corps' ZOC consists of the hex it occupies and the six surrounding hexes. All 
corps leave patrol mode when in an enemy ZOC. ZOC's do extend across river 
hexsides.

6.0 UNIT MODES

Modes are representations of troop dispositions and actions. There are Five 
types of Modes: contact, combat, march, patrol and deployment mode.

6.1  Contact mode represents the orders that the player (as the army 
commander) gives to the corps commanders concerning what the corps should do 
when it enters an enemy ZOC (or vice-versa). These orders are binding to the 
corps and must be obeyed even if the corps commander dislikes them. 
Exception: Demoralized corps always withdraw.

6.1.1 Initiative 

In this mode, the corps commander is given the opportunity to decide for 
himself the combat mode he will enter during the next reconnaisance phase. 
The decision is based on the estimated battle odds, the aggressiveness of the 
commander and the urgency of his orders.

6.1.2 Withdraw, Stand, Attack, Hasty Attack (see Section 6.2)

The Army commander(the player) orders the corps to enter the designated 
combat mode (listed above) whenever it is in an enemy ZOC regardless of the 
size of the enemy unit(s) or the risk involved.


6.2 COMBAT MODE

Combat mode orders govern the actions of the corps when in an enemy ZOC. A 
combat mode is only chosen when the corps is in an enemy ZOC. If the corps 
has a Contact Mode of Initiative, this combat mode is chosen during the next 
Reconnaissance Phase. At the end of any Execution Phase, when the corps is no 
longer in an enemy ZOC, the corps leaves its combat mode assuming an INACTIVE 
COMBAT MODE. Combat modes are either withdraw, defend, attack, or hasty 
attack.









Page 6



6.2.1 Withdraw

Withdraw mode means the unit enters force march mode, then road deployment 
mode, and moves under the following priorities: 
1) the unit may not withdraw into mountains.
2) the unit may not withdraw into an enemy occupied hex or through enemy 
lines as given in 6.2.1.1
3) The friendly unit will attempt to withdraw into the hex it was ordered to 
retreat to(see Command RT on Menu B - Section 13.2.4
4) The friendly unit will attempt to withdraw in the direction last moved.
5) The friendly unit will attempt to withdraw in any available direction, 
starting at direction 1 and moving clockwise.

Corps attempting to withdraw have only a chance of being able to safely 
withdraw. In order to withdraw safely the corps morale must be greater than 
or equal to a random number between 1 and 4. If the morale check fails, then 
all corps not in withdraw contact mode will change their combat mode to 
stand. Corps in withdrawal mode will make another morale check. If it is 
successful the corps will withdraw safely. If unsuccessful, then the corps 
will still withdraw, but it will lose 50% of its strength(less 5% for each 
leadership point of the corps commander). Losses to artillery due to an 
unsuccessful withdraw are doubled, This is called routing.
Note:If a corps is in the hex occupied by the primary army commander, the 
player will determine whether the corps will make its second attempt to 
withdraw.

6.2.1.1 - Enemy lines are defined as follows:

Whenever a unit enters an enemy occupied hex which contains no friendly 
units, the battle lines are drawn, with the direction from which the unit 
enterd the hex, and the two adjacent directions, becoming the lines of the 
side with the entering unit(the other directions become the lines of the 
enemy unit). Once the enemy lines have been drawn, additional units entering 
the hex will only change the lines if they belong to the side that had the 
original entering unit. In this case new units could increase the lines of 
the entering side while decreasing the lines of the unit originally in the 
hex.
Example: If a confederate unit enters a Union-occupied hex from direction 4 
(coming from the south), then the Confederate lines are considered to be in 
direction 3,4,and 5, while the Union lines are directions 1, 2, and 6. If 
later in the game another Confederate corps enters the hex from direction 2, 
then the Confederate lines would include directions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, while 
the Union lines would be reduced to direction 6, In this way the Union army 
may be surrounded by another Confederate corps entering from direction 1, 5, 
or 6.

6.2.2 Stand

In this mode, the unit enters normal march mode, deployment mode, then enters 
rest march mode.

6.2.3 Attack

When given this order, the unit will enter normal march mode. If no enemy 
occupies the hex, it will enter road march mode and move into an enemy 
occupied hex on the same priorities as withdrawing(ignoring priority two). 
When in an enemy occupied hex, the corps will deploy, if not deployed, and 
attack the enemy unit(s). Attacks in hexes in which there are other friendly 
corps are made separately unless an army commander is "leading the attack".

Page 7



6.2.4 Hasty Attack

The corps so ordered behaves in the same manner as an attacking corps except 
that 
1) it enters force march mode, and 2) it will not bother deploying in the 
enemy occupied hex, When attacking, undeployed units will suffer more 
casualties than deployed units.


6.3 MARCH MODE

This is the speed at which a corps executes its orders. Possible march modes 
are rest, normal, and force march.

6.3.1 Rest Mode

Units in rest mode have no movement allowance but may recover from fatigue.

6.3.2 Normal Mode

Units in normal mode have a movement allowance of 3 if infantry corps and 4 
if cavalry corps. they suffer fatigue if they move at night.

6.3.3 Force March Mode

Units in force march mode have a movement allowance of 4 if infantry corps 
and 6 if cavalry corps. But they suffer fatigue gains.

6.4 Patrol Mode

Patrol mode may only be used by cavalry corps. Corps in patrol mode have a 
reconnaisance radius of 2 hexes, and assume a normal march mode. Corps in 
enemy ZOC's or which move leave patrol mode and must be given a new order to 
once again enter patrol mode.

6.5 Deployment Mode

6.5.1 Road Mode

A corps organized in a column along a road not necessarily in a road hex is 
in Road Mode.

6.5.2 Deployed Mode

A corps deployed in battle order is in deployed mode. Corps in Road Mode may 
move. Corps in deployed mode may not move from hex to hex.

7.0 STACKING

7.1 A corps may only enter a hex if there are no friendly units in road mode 
in the hex. Corps wishing to enter a hex in which there is a friendly unit in 
road mode will force the friendly unit to deploy. If the moving corps has a 
lower unit number. For example, if corps 2 tries to enter a hex containing 
corps 1, corps 2 will wait until corps 1 deploys or leaves the hex. If corps 
1 tries to enter a hex containing corps 2, corps 2 will be forced to deploy in
 order to allow corps 1 to enter the hex.

7.2  Army HQ units may always stack with friendly units and not block 
friendly units from entering their hex.                      Page 8




7.3 Units with an active combat mode do not count for stacking purposes.


8.0 MOVEMENT

During the execution phase the computer will move each player's units as per 
their orders. A unit's movement allwance is dependent on its march mode and 
corps type (infantry or cavalry). Each unit will deduct from its movement 
allowance a number of movement points for each action performed during the 
turn. Unused movement points are not transferred from unit to unit nor 
accumulated from turn to turn; However the effects of spent movement points 
do accumulate from turn to turn. Example: A normal marching infantry corps 
spends two movement points to move one hex and then spends its last movement 
point towards entering another hex. On the next turn, the unit will only use 
one movement point to enter the next hex. Corps receiving an SU, PT, or CM 
order while not in a ZOC will be slightly delayed despite the fact that there 
is no movement cost associated with these commands.

8.1 Night Turns (2100)

During night turns, units have 1-1/2 their normal movement allowance and gain 
fatigue at three times the normal rate. No combat may occur at night. Units 
normal marching at night gain one fatigue point. Units withdrawing at night 
withdraw in normal march mode instead of force march mode.

8.2  Units not moving from one road hex to another road hex gain 1/2 of a 
fatigue point (In effect, these units are moving on secondary roads which is 
not as easy to do as moving on the main roads shown on the mapboard).

8.3  If two opposing units try to enter each others's hex, at the same 
instant, then only the confederate forces would move.

8.4  Rivers not crossed from a road hex to another road hex (i.e. an 
unbridged hexside) cause the gain of a fatigue point. Confederate units may 
never cross rivers.

8.5  Mountain hexes may never be entered.


8.6 Rain Turns

During rain turns, all movement point costs are doubled. All orders which 
have begun to be executed during a rain turn will take twice as long to 
execute. Thus a unit which begins to cross a river during a rain turn would 
spend 8 movement points crossing the river and entering the hex, even if the 
move was completed during a non-rain turn. No combat may occur during rain 
turns.

Page 9



8.8 Morning Turns (0500)

During 0500 turns all units have 1/2 their normal movement allowance but gain 
and lose fatigue normally.

8.9 Effects of Urgency and Leadership on Movement

A corps will choose its march mode based on the urgency given the corps and 
the aggressiveness of the leader of the corps. The higher the urgency the 
greater the chances a unit will force march and less the chance a unit will 
rest. Also, the higher the leader's aggressiveness the greater the chance of 
force march and the lower the chance of rest. At night units will move as if 
their urgency was set 3 lower than it actually is. Units which have had their 
march mode set for them(either by force movement or the SM command) will 
follow the march mode given and will not look at their urgency or leadership.

8.10 Stragglers

Infantry corps in normal or force march mode may suffer the loss of infantry 
from straggling. Infantry corps in rest mode (or corps expending 0 movement 
points) regain infantry lost from straggling. Infantry lost from straggling 
are considered eliminated for all purposes except that they may be regained 
through rest.

8.10.1 Corps lose the following percentage of their infantry strength per 
turn due to straggling (determined at random).:

                                           FORCE         NIGHT        NIGHT
                             NORMAL        MARCH         NORMAL       FORCE
                              MODE          MODE          MODE         MODE
         UNION                0-1           0-4           0-6          0-12
   CONFEDERATE                 0            0-2           0-2          0-6

8.10.2 Corps in rest mode (or corps expending 0 movement points) regain 1 
strength point (100 men) of stragglers per turn.

9.0 COMBAT

Any time a hex is occupied by two opposing forces during a non-rain day turn, 
and one of the forces is undemoralized, combat may occur. Combat occurs when 
either or both of the forces expends a movement point to attack the opposing 
force.

9.1 Which Units Participate in Combat

All enemy units in the battle hex will be attacked. If a friendly army 
commander with attack orders is in the hex then all friendly units with 
attack orders will participate. 
Note: This is the only difference between a secondary army commander and a 
normal corps
commander. If there is no friendly army commander with attack orders in the 
hex, each friendly unit with attack orders will attack independently. Note: 
This tactic can be devastating if each attacking corps can get acceptable 
odds. Under most circumstances a unit will only be permitted to attack once 
during a turn. However, if the army commander(or secondary army commander, if 
the army commander in not present) starts spending movement points after a 
combat has occurred, and does attack during the turn, the other friendly 
corps with attack orders will join in.

Page 10



 Example: Union units in hex 12,5 attack a Confederate unit at the beginning 
of a turn, and later during the same turn Meade enters the hex and initiates 
an attack. The Union units will join the superior leader in the attack and 
thus attack twice in the same turn.

9.2  Reconnaisance will be performed prior to each battle. If one side thinks 
it is outnumbered by 1:1.75 or worse, it will temporarily assume an urgency 
of 1 if its contact mode is initiative, it will assume: stand combat mode.

9.2.1 Reconnaisance is performed by comparing the cavalry strengths of the 
opposing sides. The more cavalry strength that a side has over his 
opponent(including morale and effectiveness), the more accurate will be his 
reconnaisance. Error in reconnaisance will vary from_+10% to _+50%, Forces 
with equal cavalry strengths will have a reconnaisance error of _+35%.

9.2.2 The combat strengths of both sides will be adjusted by applicable 
combat shifts as follows: A combat multiple is determined for each unit type 
for each corps and is multiplied by the unit type strength. Example: a corps 
has 50 infantry strength points and 20 foot gun strenth points. The multiple 
for the infantry might be 8 and the multiple for the foot guns 12. The combat 
strength for the corps would be 640 (8 X 50 + 12 X 20 = 640).
The multiple is made up of all applicable combat shifts listed below:

Cavalry                             +1.5        Confederate                 +2
Cavalry in withdraw combat mode     +1          Horse guns                  +3
Cavalry in a town hex               -2          Foot guns                   
+2.5
Cavalry in road mode                +1          Corps morale -              +1
unit deployed                       +5          per morale point
unit in stand combat mode           +6          Unit effectiveness -        +1
unit in attack combat mode          +3          per effectiveness point
unit in hasty attack combat mode    +2

9.2.3 If the army headquarters is in the battle hex the player will be given 
the estimated battle odds by using the estimated strengths determined in 
9.2.1 and 9.2.2. With this information the player will be asked  what urgency 
is desired in the battle. The response should be a number between 0 and 9, 
Inclusive. An army headquarters unit which is attacking may give an urgency 
of 0. which tells the attacking units to abort the attack in 
progress(however, the units will remain in combat mode attack).A defending 
army head-quarters unit which gives an urgency of 0 will have its urgency 
automatically set to 1.

9.3 Now the real battle odds are determined in a manner identical to above, 
except that no reconnaisance error is factored. These battle odds are 
expressed as a ratio of 1:n or n:1, where n is a number greater than or equal 
to 1. Example: 3:1, 1:4, 2.2:1.

9.4 Next, the leadership odds are determined. The leadership odds are the 
ratio of each side's average leadership(with the controlling leader valued as 
three leaders when determining the average). The controlling leader is the 
senior army commander , or if no army commander is present, the leader of the 
lowest numbered corps.

9.5 The two ratios determined in 9.3 and 9.4 when multiplied together give 
the combat odds. Example: The battle odds are 2:1, the leadership odds are 
1:1.5. the combat odds would be approximately 2:1.5 or 1.3333:1 ( there is a 
random factor thrown in).

Casualties are based on three things: the ferocity of the battle, the combat 
odds, and the unit types involved.

9.6.1 Ferocity is what controls the number of losses. ferocity is determined 
by taking the urgency of each commander and, for each point odf difference 
between their leaderships, temporarily adjusting the urgency of the inferior 
commander 1 point towards that of the superior commander. Now average the 
superior leader's urgency with the adjusted urgency. This is the ferocity of 
the battle. Example: Leader A has an urgency of 3 and a leadership of 8. 
leader B has an urgency of 9 and a leadership of 5. the adjusted urgency 
would be 6 and the ferocity would be 4 (3 + 6) / 2 = 4. The table below shows 
the percentage casualty rate due to ferocity.

FEROCITY   1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8      9
CASUALTY   3    6    9   12    15    18    21    24     27

9.6.1.1 The Effects of Leadership Aggressiveness on Combat Urgency

In order to determine the final urgency used by each commander in a battle, 
first find the average aggressiveness of each side's leaders involved in the 
combat and divide the number for each side by 10. Add this number to the 
urgency of the leader commanding the battle(primary, secodary, or lowest 
number leader) to find the actual urgency used by each side. Example: Union 
leaders have an aggressiveness of -30, 10, 0, -20, 0 and the Union commander 
has given an urgency of 7 for the battle. The average of the leader 
aggressiveness ratings is -8 ((-30+10+0-20+0)/5) and this divided by 10 is 
-8. adding this to the 7 urgency creates an urgency of 6.2 or 6(round to the 
nearest integer). Thus, the Unaggressiveness of some of the Union leaders has 
reduced the Union battle urgency.

9.6.1.2 Union Echelon Attacks (deciding who is in the front lines and who is 
in reserve)

Before a battle each army commander (or the computer if there is no friendly 
primary commander in the battle0 will be asked to rank his corps for combat 
purposes. Based on the urgency of the battle each army's corps will be 
divided into three echelons, with the higher ranked corps(numbers closer to 
1) being in the first echelons(front lines) and the lower ranked corps in the 
second and third echelons (different states of reserve). The higher the 
battle urgency the greater the number of troops placed in the first echelon 
(it is assumed that the commander desires more troops to be in the initial 
assault. Units in the front lines (echelon one and to a lesser extent echelon 
two) have a greater impact on the combat odds, but they also suffer greater 
losses. In this way a commander must decide when to commit his high 
effectiveness corps by giving them a high combat priority, for by doing so 
the combat odds will increase, but of course, so will the losses sustained by 
the guard corps.

9.6.2  The combat odds determine the ratio of casualties between the two 
forces. For instance, if the ferocity were 6 and the combat odds were 3:1, 
then the casualty rate would be 18%. The loser(the weaker force) would lose 
18% and the winner lose 6%. The losses are a percentage of the smaller force. 
However, if a corps is demoralized its loss will be a percentage of the 
larger force. Example: In the above case, the winning force had 50,000 men. 
The losing force had 30,000 men. Therefore, the losing force would lose 
5400(30,000 X .18) men and the winning force would lose 1,8000(30,000 X .06) 
men. In this case the winner actually lost only 3.6% or 3% of his force 
involved and that is what the battle report would read.

Page 12



9.6.3 Once the number of losses are determine, these losses are distributed 
throughout the involved corps.

9.7 If the combat odds are either 1:15 or 15:1 then the weaker force is 
destroyed (surrendered).

9.8 If corps' strength falls below 15% of its original strength due to 
combat, it is destroyed.

9.9 When the Union 11th corps is eliminated it will reappear immediately at 
hex 20,18. When the Confederate 11th corps is eliminated it will reappear 
immediately at hex 1,7. Eliminated headquarters units will be assigned a 
random leadership value.

9.10 Corps leaders may be lost due to combat. If a leader is killed, he is 
replaced by another leader with a semi-randomly assigned leadership and 
aggressiveness rating. Lee and Meade may never be killed, unless their HQ 
corps is eliminated. A corps gains 1/2 of a fatigue point when its leader is 
killed.

9.11 Each side in combat may suffer additional fatigue from their adjusted 
urgency as shown below:

Adjusted Urgency    1     2     3    4     5     6     7     8     9
Fatigue Gained      1    3/4   1/2  1/4    0    1/4   1/2   3/4    1

Thus commanders are advised to use urgency 5 unless they are willing to 
suffer the additional fatigue.


10.0 DISPATCHES
 
Dispatches take two forms: The report and the order. During his Player Phase, 
a player will receive reports that were sent during previous Reconnaisance 
and/or Execution Phases.
During the Order Receipt Phase, the corps will receive orders which were 
issued during previous Player Phases.

10.1 Battle reports are sent during any Execution Phase in which a battle 
occurs. Battle reports arrive during the friendly Player Phase of the 
following turn, adding one turn for each six hexes distance between the primar
y headquarters and the battle.

10.2 Reconnaisance reports and location reports are sent during each 
Reconnaisance Phase. They arrive during the friendly Player Phase of the same 
turn, adding one turn for each six hexes distance between the primary 
headquarters and the reporting corps.

10.3 Activity reports are not dispatches but are intelligence estimates of 
current troop concentrations(derived from such things as sun glinting on 
metal, fires, shots, spies, etc.) for each occupied hex on the map there is a 
16% chance that an activity report will be issued on it each turn. There is 
also the possibility of false reports.

10.4 Orders are sent each turn during the friendly Player Phase and arrive 
during the Order Receipt phase of the same turn, adding one turn for each six 
hexes distance between the primary headquarters and the receiving corps at 
the time the orders are sent.

11.0 CORPS MORALE AND FATIGUE

Corps morale represents the corps' fatigue and willingness to fight. When 
corps morale reaches zero, the corps is demoralized. Demoralized corps suffer 
higher casualties in combat. A demoralized corps is automatically given a 
contact mode of withdraw, an urgency of 1, and loses all its previous 
non-immediate and combat immediate orders. Demoralized corps may not be sent 
new contact mode or urgency orders(if they are sent they are purged from the 
orders and are not read by the corps). The clearing of orders and the setting 
of contact mode withdraw for demoralized corps occurs only just after a 
combat or during the fatigue phase. Note: An army commander may not stop a 
demoralized corps from withdrawing. The morale of a corps is equal to CORPS 
EFFECTIVENESS / FATIGUE LEVEL.

11.1 Fatigue is increased due to combat. For every 5% casualties suffered, 
the corps gains one fatigue point. Partial fatigue may be gained from lower 
casualties. Example: 6% losses + 1.5 fatigue points gained.

11.2 Corps in force march mode gain one fatigue point per turn.

11.3 All corps in rest mode or corps that have not expended any movement 
points lose 1 fatigue point.

11.4 The gain of fatigue is tripled at night. Units normal marching at night 
gain 1 fatigue point.

11.5 Each unit gains 1/2 of a fatigue point when moving to or from a non-road 
hex.

11.6 Each unit gains 1 fatigue point when crossing an unbridged river 
hexside. This is in addition to the fatigue gained through provisions of 
section 11.5.

11.7 Non HQ corps with 15 or more fatigue points are destroyed.


12.0 ORDER TYPES

There are three types of orders that may be given...immediate orders, combat 
immediate orders, and non-immediate orders. Immediate orders are orders which 
are executed during the orders phase such as RT(retreat), or any order from 
Menu A. Non-immediate orders are those which are entered into the dispatch, 
and, when they arrive, they will eliminate any orders the receiving corps has 
been working on or had not yet started to execute. Non-immediate orders will 
also eliminate any movement points spent towards executing an action. Combat 
immediate orders are orders which are sent by dispatch. If the unit receiving 
the orders is in a ZOC at the time of receipt, then the orders are treated as 
immediate orders. If the corps is not in a ZOC, then the combat immediate 
orders are treated as non-immediate orders. it is important that the player 
understand that issuing orderseach turn is much less efficient(and probably 
futile) than sending one dispatch with series of orders that will take many 
turns to execute. Also, note that reissuing orders to a corps during the same 
orders phase after having returned to Menu A will cause the loss of the 
orders already issued to that corps during that orders phase.
Note: Since combat immediate orders being received are executed at once if 
the corps is in a ZOC at the time of receipt, the corps will execute even 
those combat immediate orders which are at the end of the dispatch. This can 
cause a corps to assume stand mode when you wanted it to stand after it had 
finished executing its movement orders.


Page 14




13.0 THE ORDERS

A player may give orders which 1) do not go to the player's corps(but which 
give information or decisions affecting the strategic situation) 2) orders to 
the corps or 
3) orders to a group of corps or 'force'.

13.1 Menu A: Startegic Orders

Orders from Menu A are given in response to the question "What are your 
orders, sir?". 
The following is a list of possible answers to that question.

13.1.1 LM: Look at Map

1. The player is first aked "Hexon?" an answer of"Y" will cause the hex grid 
to appear with the map. Any other key will eliminate the hex grid.

2. The player is then asked "What corner hex(X, Y)?". The response should be 
the x,y coordinates of the desired upper lefthand corner hex inputed as two 
numbers separated by a comma. the x coordinate must be the integer number 
between 1 and 9, the y coordinate an integer between 1 and 13.

3. The map is now displayed. then following is a key to the map 
(SEE THE MAP TERRAIN KEY AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MAP)

4. The computer now asks " Do you wish to continue looking at the map (Y or 
N)?". If the answer is yes, the computer repeats the routine from step 2, If 
the answer is no, the computer returns to Menu A.

13.1.2 SR: Status Report

The computer will display the current status of all units in one turn 
dispatch distance (demoralized corps will be shown in inverse). The display 
might look like this:

CORPS   EFF   FAT   INF   CAV   GUNS   STR   URG   %

1W      3.8    3    103    0     25     3     7    50

6A      5.2    0    125    0    102    11     5   100

11S     9.0    0      0    4      0     0     1   100

Under Corps is the corps number and current contact mode: Eff is the Average 
Effectiveness Rating of the Corps and FAT is the amount of fatigue suffered 
(the FAT is a truncated value). The Corps morale is equal to the Average 
Effectiveness Rating +2 -Fatigue suffered. In the above example, the 6th 
Corps would have a morale of 7.2 and the 1st Corps a morale of 2.8 (See Corps 
Morale). INF and CAV are the current number of infantry and cavalry, measured 
in hundreds of men. GUNS is the number of eight pounder equivalent cannons 
the corps has. For Example, four six-pounders would be rated as 3. STR is the 
number of current stragglers, measured in hundreds of men. URG is the current 
urgency rating of the corps and CON is the current contact mode. % is the 
percentage of the corp's original strength remaining.


Page 15




13.1.3 DC: Designate Commander

This will redesignate the secondary army commander. The computer will ask 
"What Corps Commander?". This corps commander will instantly become the 
secondary army commander. While the previous secondary army commander will 
join the ranks.

13.1.4 SG: Save Game

This allows the players to save a game in progress.

13.1.5 ET: End Turn

This will end the current turn.

13.1.6 OC: Order Corps

The player gives orders to a specific corps (Menu B). If any non-immediate 
orders(see Menus B & C) are given and arrive on a turn in which previously 
given orders arrive, then the previously given orders are replaced by the new 
orders (i.e., the last issued set of orders are the ones that count). The 
computer asks "Orders to Whom?". When the answer (the corps to be given 
orders) is received, the computer transfers the player to Menu B.

13.1.7 Order Force

The first thing the computer does is find all corps eligible to be in the 
force and asks the player one by one if that corps is desired in the force. 
To be eligible, a corps must be within two hexes of its army HQ unit. The 
computer will ask "What march rate do you wish (R, N, F)?. The answer will 
apply to the slowest corps in the force, while the march rate for each corps 
will be the slowestthey can manage while travelling at the given speed. 
Example: A force of one cavalry corps and one infantry corps(the slowest) 
receive orders to march at force march rate. Theentire force would have 4 
MP's that turn which for the infantry corps, would be force marching, but for 
the cavalry corps this is normal marching. Thus, part of the force may force 
march while another part normal marches, but they will all move with the same 
speed(Note: This ability to specify the march rate can be helpful in 
preventing a unit in the lead of a column from blocking the column by 
resting. The march mode forced upon the corps only lasts one turn). The 
computer now transfers the player to Menu C. As with OC, The last set of 
orders issued are the ones that are executed ( Note: the defined force and 
march speed last only one turn, though any orders given last as long as they 
normally would).

13.1.8 LD: Look at Dispatches

The turn's dispatches will be shown to the player.

13.2 Menu B: Orders to Corps

Orders from Menu B are given in response to the question "ORDERS?" The 
following is a list of possible answers to the question.



Page 16




13.2.1 SU: Set Urgency

This is a combat immediate command in which the player orders a change of 
urgency for the corps. This change, like all non-immediate orders (see 
section 13.1.6), is made when the order is reached in the order set. Thus, 
the corps could move 3 hexes with an urgency of 5, change the urgency to 7 
and continue moving under the new urgency. however, this would necessitate 2 
MV commands in that set. The computer prompts the player with the question
"SET TO WHAT URGENCY (1-9)?".

13.2.2 SM: Set March Mode

This is an immediate command (it is not put into the orders but executed 
immediately) and can only be given to the 11th Corps. If you wish to give 
march mode orders to a corps it must be done by an OF command from Menu A or 
by an SU command from Menu's B & C (though this will only influence the 
chance of a given march mode). The prompt by the computer is
"SET TO WHAT MARCH MODE (R, N, F)?".

13.2.3 CM: Set Contact Mode

This is a combat immediate command which sets the contact mode of the corps. 
After this command is given, the moment the corps enters an enemy ZOC the 
combat mode will automatically turn to whatever the contact mode of the unit 
is set at (if the contact mode is initiative the corps will, of course wait 
until it has performed reconnaisance before choosing its combat mode). The 
computer prompts with " WHAT CONTACT(I,W,S,A,H)?" and will
require confirmation.

13.2.4 RT: Retreat to Hex

This is an immediate command which sets the number 1 priority hex to which a 
corps should withdraw. This command can only be given a corps within one turn 
dispatch distance and the hex must not be a forest hex. The computer asks 
"RETREAT TO WHAT HEX(X,Y)?". The player should respond with the coordinates 
of a hex adjacent to the withdrawing corps. This order does not force a corps 
to withdraw; it just sets the retreat priority hex in the event of a 
withdrawal. This order will last until the unit is moved one hex. this order 
may only be given to units in immediate dispatch range.

13.2.5 AT: Attack Hex

This is an immediate command which sets the number 1 priority hex to move 
into and attack. The AT command has identical restrictions as the RT command 
and the prompt "ATTACK WHAT HEX (X,Y)?" is responded to in the same way. this 
order, once given, will last until a unit moves one hex. This order may only 
be given to units in immediate dispatch range.
Note: this does not place a corps in attack mode.

13.2.6 RE: Reinforce Hex

This is an immediate command which tells a corps that it should attempt to 
reinforce a hex containing friendly units without attacking eneny units in 
the hex. The corps must have a combat mode of attack or hasty attack in order 
for this command to be executed. The order is treated exactly as if it were 
an AT order wxcept that combat will not be initiated. Unlike an AT orderwhich 
will last until the unit has moved. An RE order will last for only one turn.

Page 17




If an army commander has an RE order and enters a hex where a battle is about 
to occur the battle will not occur (unless the entering unit is a secondary 
army commander and it enters a hex containing the primary commander). This 
order may only be given to units in immediate dispatch range.

13.2.7 MV: Move

This is a non-immediate command which controls the movement of the corps. The 
computer Asks "STARTING HEX (X,Y)?" to determine where the player believes 
the corps will be when it receives the orders. The computer will center the 
map arounfd the starting hex and then ask "DIRECTION?". The answer is the 
direction in which the cursor should be moved. defined as follows:

                                   ____1___
                                  /        \
                               6 /          \ 2
                                /            \
                                \            /
                               5 \          / 3
                                  \        /
                                       4

The cursor will move to the new hex, the cursor and current hexes listed will 
be updated and the computer will ask for directions again. If the direction 
given leads the cursor off the screen the current hex will remain unchanged, 
but the map will be recentered about the cursor. The path of the cursor will 
become the intended movement path of the unit being ordered. If the corps is 
not within 1 hex of the starting hex when the MV order is executed, the corps 
will force march until it arrives on the path defined.

13.2.8 PT: Patrol

This is a non-immediate command which will cause the corps to assume normal 
march and patrol mode until it moves or occupies a hex in an enemy ZOC.

13.2.9 CD: Change Deployment Mode

This is a non-immediate command which will cause the corps to enter the 
deployment mode given in response to the question "CHANGE DEPLOYMENT TO WHAT 
(R<D)?. R: Road Mode, 
D: Deployed.

13.2.10 EX: Exit Menu

This immediate command returns the player to Menu A.

13.2.11 OC: Order Corps

This is the equivalent to giving an EX order followed by an OC order.

13.2.12 CS: Corps Status

This order may only be given to corps within one turn dispatch distance. When 
given the command it will cause the display of the corps' current combat 
mode, deployment mode, current hex, and a list of all orders the unit will 
attempt to execute.

                                    Page 18



13.2.13 XU: Exit Unit

This is an immediate command which will result in the unit exiting the map if 
it is on washington exit hex. This command can only be given to a corps 
within one turn dispatch distance. The order will result in the immediate 
exiting of the unit. If a headquarters unit is exited, the player can still 
give orders and receive reports as if the HQ unit was located in the hex from 
which it exited.

13.3 Menu C: Force Orders

Orders from Menu C are given in response to the question "FORCE ORDERS?". The 
following is a list of possible answers to the question.

13.3.1 SU: Set Urgency

See 13.2.1

13.3.2 CM: Set Contact Mode

See 13.2.3

13.3.3 MV: Move

See 13.2.7

13.3.4 PT: Patrol

See 13.2.8

13.3.5 CD: Change Deployment Mode

See 13.2.9

13.3.6 EX: Exit Menu

See 13.2.10

13.4 It is important to realize that under normal circumstances it is not 
necessary to order corps to enter road or deployed mode, for movement orders 
and contact mode orders will automatically shift corps into the proper 
deployment mode for the action being performed.

14.0 FORCES AND HOW TO USE THEM (or, the care and feeding of your corps)

As related previously, forces are made up of one or more corps within two 
hexes of the primary army commander (the army commander does not have to be 
part of the force). Two or more forces may be formed during a given turn as 
long as each corps meets the above conditions. However, if one corps is made 
a member of two forces it will only receive the orders given to the second 
force. Forces last only one turn, though their orders are not destroyed.


                
Page 19



14.1 Forces make it easy to issue orders to many corps at once, instead of 
each individually. Any movement orders should use as a starting hex the 
location of the rearmost corps, tracing the movement path through the other 
members of the force (if they are not in the same hex0. The front units will 
not wait for the rest of the force but will act on their orders 
independently, moving along the movement path until they reach the 
destination hex.

14.2 Forces can be used to control the speed of the corps and thus control a 
stack, keeping the cavalry corps from moving way ahead. Likewise, the force 
can be used to make corps rest, normal, or force march as desired.
Note: The speed of a force is the speed of the slowest unit. Therefore, if a 
cavalry corps and an infantry corps compose a force which receives force 
march orders, then the infantry corps will force march (MP=4) and the cavalry 
corps will normal march (MP=4).

14.3 If a force is given no new orders which would normally cause it to lose 
its old orders, then the commander can still control the speed (march mode) 
of the force without changing its orders. This can be repeated every turn.

15.0 OPTIONAL BATTLE

Players may elect to resolve combat situations by using methods of their own 
choosing (such as with the use of minitures). if optional combat is selected 
at the beginning of the game the computer will give the players the option to 
resolve each combat off-line (without the computer). if the players choose 
off-line combat, the computer will list the statistics of all units involved 
in the battle and then allow the players to save the game. when the game is 
restarted, the players will be asked to enter the casualties and fatigue 
suffered by each corps in the battle.

THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG  SCENARIO DATA CARD
I. CAMPAIGN GAME JUNE 28 - JULY 4, 1863

In this scenario the Confederate army is trying to live off the land while 
avoiding combat unless an opportunity for a major victory presents itself.

A. Game Time

The game begins on June 28 (day 1) with the 0500 turn and ends after the 
fatigue phase of the 2100 turn on July 4 (day 7). Rain is expected by July 4, 
but is may occur a day or two earlier or it may never occur.

B. Special Rules

1) In solitaire mode the computer will control the Union forces. 
2) Confederate Units in rest mode (or Confederate units which expend no 
movement points during the turn) which are not in an enemy occupied hex are 
considered to be foraging. Each hex may only support a limited amount of 
foraging before being depleted. Town hexes may be foraged five times (one 
unit five turns, five units one turn, two units, for two turns and one unit 
for one turn,etc.), road hexes three times, and clear hexes twice. however, 
as each hex is foraged, the victory points scored for that hex decreases. The 
first time a town hex is foraged the Confederate player will receive 5 
victory points, the second time 4 points, etc., until one point is received 
on the fifth forage in the same town hex. The first time a road hex is 
foraged the Conferderate player will be awarded three victory points, the 
second time, two points and the third time one point. The first time a clear 
hex is foraged the Confederate player will receive two points, the second 
time one point. No foraging will occur in a hex that has been depleted.(i.e. 
foraged the maximum number of times allowed by terrain of the hex).
3) We suggest that the Confederate player place a blank counter in any hex 
foraged(one blank counter per forage). In thids manner the confederate player 
will know at a glance the extent of the forAging which has taken place in 
each hex.

C. Victory Conditions

The Confederate player receives victory points for the following:
Points Received      Action Performed
+300                 Union 11th corps eliminated
+150                 Each Union corps eliminated
+50                  Each Union corps demoralized at the end of the game
+10                  Each 10% of a Union corps destroyed at the end of the 
game
                     (not counting eliminated Union corps)
+1                   Each Confederate Strength point over 300 exited towards 
Washington         
                     (i.e. 450 exited points would yield 150 Confederate 
victory points)
-10                  Each 10% of a confederate corps destroyed at the end of 
the game 
                     (not including eliminated confederate corps)
-50                  Each Confederate corps demoralized at the end of the 
game.
-150                 Each Confederate corps eliminated
-300                 Confederate 11th corps eliminated

Victory is determined by comparing the total Confederate Victory points at 
the end of the game with thw following schedule:

500+            Confederate Decisive Victory
250 to 499      Confederate Substantive Victory
 
Page 23



125 to 249      Confederate Marginal Victory
75 to 124       Draw
-50 to -74      Union Marginal Victory
-300 to -75     Union Substantive Victory
-301 or less    Union Decisive Victory


II. THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG, JULY 1 - JULY 3, 1863

With the accidental meeting of Heth's and Buford's divisions outside 
Gettysburg, battle is forced upon the Confederate Army. Lee must strike 
quickly and win the battle on the first day, or face a united Union army 
larger than his own.

A. Game Time

This game begins on july 1 (day 4) with the 0900 turn and ends after the 
fatigue phase of the 2100 turn on July 3 (day 6). There is a slight chance of 
rain towards the end of the game.

B. Special Rules

1) In solitaire mode the computer will control the Union forces.
2) Heth's division and Buford's division begin the game with 2 fatigue points.
3) The game begins with enemy lines drawn in Gettysburg based on the 
following: Buford entered Gettysburg from hex 12,9 and was the first unit in 
the Hex. Doubleday entered gettysburg from hex 12,8, Heth and Pender entered 
gettysburg from 11,8. Thus Union lines are in directions 2,3,4. confederate 
lines are in directions 1,5,6. and the Union army is considered to have the 
original entering units in hex 12,8.

C. Victory Conditions

The confederate player receives victory points for the following:

Points Received          Action performed
+300                     11th Union corps eliminated
+150                     Each Union corps eliminated
+100                     Confederate units are considered to be the original 
entering 
                         units in hex 12,8 (Gettysburg at the end of the game 
(this can 
                         happen if at any time there are confederate units in 
Gettysburg 
                         and no Union units in Gettysburg, See section 
6.2.1.1 for details 
                         on original entering unit.)
+50                      Each Union corps demoralized at the end of the game.
+1                       Each 1% of a Union corps destroyed at the end of the 
game.
+1 to +5                 Points awarded for foraging as explained in section 
B. campaign
+1                       Each Confederate strength point over 300 exited 
towards 
                         Washington(same as for the Campaign scenario)
-1                       Each 1% of Confederate corps destroyed at the end of 
the game.
-50                      Each Confederate corps demoralized at the end of the 
game.
-100                     Union units are considered to be the original 
entering units in 
                         hex 12,8 Gettysburg at the end of the game.
-150                     Each Confederate corpd eliminated.
-300                     Confederate 11th corps eliminated.

Victory is determined by comparing the total Confederate victory points at 
the end of the game with the following schedule:

 375+                Confederate Decisive Victory
+125 to 374          Confederate Substantive Victory
   0 to 124          Confederate Marginal Victory
 -50 to -1           Draw
-175 to -51          Union Marginal Victory
-425 to -174         Union Substantive Victory
-426 or less         Union Decisive Victory

SPECIAL NOTE:
For the purposes of determining fatigue, forage and straggling the computer 
will check the march mode of the unit at the end of the execution phase. 
Example, A confederate unit is in hex 5,8 with force orders to force march to 
hex 5,9 withcontact mode initiative while union unit stands in hex 5,10. 
during the execution phase the confederate unit enters 5,9, enters normal 
march and deploys, then enters rest mode due to the initiative order(units 
with initiative contact mode will always initially assume stand combat mode, 
changing the contact mode only after the next reconnaisance phase. Since the 
unit is in rest mode at the end of the execution phase it would recover one 
fatigue point, regain 100 stragglers, and forage hex 5,9.
