QUICK START RULES - THE BASIC GAME

1.0 START-UP
These rules allow the player to quickly get into a simple and straightforward
game with a minimum of rules reading. Those of you who wish more complexity
and realism are invited to play the INTERMEDIATE and ADVANCED games.

1.1 Starting the Game (C-64)
To begin the game, insert the game disk and type LOAD"*",8 and press (RETURN).
When READY appears, type RUN and press (RETURN).

1.2 Starting the Game (Atari)
Remove all cartridges from your computer. Boot-up the front side of the disk
(800XL owners will have to hold down the OPTION key when they turn on their
computer to boot). After selecting the starting values for your game, you will
be instructed to insert the Game side of your disk.

1.3 Starting the Game (Apple)
To begin the game, boot your game disk with the front side up and the game
will start automatically. If you are using the Apple Iic or Iie, keep the CAPS
LOCK key depressed throughout the game.

1.4 Starting the Game (IBM)
To begin the game, remove the BASIC cartridge (if using the IBM Pcjr) and
insert your 2.0 to 3.2 DOS disk in the drive. Turn on the computer system and
DOS will boot in. Press RETURN until you see the ready "A>". Insert your game
diskette. Type START, press ENTER, and the game will boot. On the start-up
menu, you will find an option to use an RGB, composite (including TV), or
black and white (green screen included) monitor. The IBM version has
additional menus that allow you to choose the 10-key option (movement compass
using "8" for moving North instead of standard "1") and also allow you to
adjust the screen to the right or left and change the colors. On these menus,
simply press the key that corresponds to the desired options.

1.5 Main Menu
When the game is booted and past the title page, you will see a menu with a
list of options. At a later time you may wish to use these menu options. See
2.1 of the INTERMEDIATE and ADVANCED Game rules. For Quick Start purposes,
leave the default selections and press the RETURN key.


2.0 ACTIVATION

Not all Union units will be allowed to move. Porter's Corps cannot move until
turn five (10:00AM), Franklin's Corps until turn seven (12:00 Noon),
Pleasanton's Division until turn eight (1:00 PM). The above limits may be
changed due to a random factor or if the enemy moves next to the above units.
If you wish to have this restriction removed, then set the Activation
Option,#9, on the Main Menu to NO. In the IBM version, Union cavalry unit may
not be activated until turn 3.


3.0 OPERATION PHASE
During this phase you are allowed to move and plot melee  combat for all your
troops. Most actions require you to spend operation points (see Operation
Costs Table).

3.1 Cursor Menu
When you first enter the Operation Phase, you will see the following menu
below the map.

(V)         = Highlights all the squares that a unit could see from that square.
(0)         = Centers the map at the cursor.
(1-8)       = Moves the cursor in the desired direction according to the compass on the 
              right hand side of the display.
(T)         = Removes unit shapes from the map so you can see the terrain underneath.
(C)         = Takes you the Combat Phase - press this key when you are finished moving.
(SPACE BAR) = Picks up the unit under the cursor to allow you to give it commands. If two 
              or more units are in the square, you will pick. up the first unit. You are 
              now in the command Menu for that ynit.

3.2 Unit Information
When you pick up a unit, the unit statistics are displayed below the map such
as the example below:

CONFED RIPLEY - A INF 501 MEN
RFL   EFF:83 FT:0 MORALE:83
OP:7     MELEE:N  FIRE:17,34
ROAD(3)      X,Y:16,34

The above display shows that the Confederate unit, RIPLEY A is INFANTRY with
501 men. Its men are armed with RIFLES, has an EFFICIENCY of 83, a FATIGUE of
0, and a MORALE of 83. It has 7 OPERATION POINTS left, does not wish to MELEE
and has plotted FIRE into square 17,34. The unit is on a ROAD square with an
elevation of (3). It is located on square 16,34. The direction compass is
located on the right hand side. Units have different shapes on the map
according to the type of unit (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery) and the stacking.

3.3 Command Menu
As soon as you pick up a unit the Command Menu fot that unit is ready for any
commands. The commands you may select are listed below:

(0)   = Centers map on the unit.
(1-8) = Moves unit in the desired direction as indicated by the compass.
(M)   = Plots the unit to MELEE combat.
(F)   = Takes you to the Target Menu. which allows you to set a priority fire square.
(V)   = Allows you to view all squares that you can fire into.You see in a 360 degree arc.
(T)   = Removes unit shapes from the map so you can see the terrain underneath.
(H)   = Displays list of commands available in this menu.
(U)   = Picks up the next unit in the square.
(N)   = Goes to the next unit on the map in promotion order (this is the order of units 
        present in the Order of Battle).
(Z)   = Aborts or cancels the actions of the unit you have currently picked up. The unit 
        returns to its original square.
(Q)   = Puts down the unit and takes you back to the Cursor Menu.

3.4 Moving A Unit
When you have picked up a unit you may move it in the desired direction
according to the compass. Moving costs you operation points, according to the
Operation Costs Chart. Your units receive 10 operation points each OPERATION
PHASE. If you don't use up all your operation points, up to two points will be
added to your allowance of 10 for the next phase of the turn. If you don't
have enough operation points you won't be allowed to move into the square. You
can't move into a square that would cause it to have too many units. If you
move an artillery unit, it may not fire until the next phase.

3.5 Stacking
A square may have one or two infantry or cavalry units. In addition it may
have one artillery unit.

3.6 Zones of Control
The eight squares that a unit is next to is defined as its Zone of Control
(ZOC). This Zone of Control costs enemy units 2 extra operation points to move
into. Routed units are eliminated if forced to retreat into an enemy Zone of
Control. A unit must have 10 operation points to move ZOC to ZOC. Artillery
may not move ZOC to ZOC.

3.7 Fire Plots
A unit will fire at the closest enemy unit it can see unless you have set a
priority fire square it can fire into. To plot the square, press "F" in the
Command menu. It will take you to the Target menu that allows you to move the
cursor over the square and press "T" to set it as the priority target. In the
Target menu you may also press "V" to view your line of fire or "E" to exit
the menu.

3.8 Melee Plot
If you wish to plot a unit to engage in melee (hand-to-hand) combat, press "M"
in the Command menu. The unit will melee the enemy unit it fired at if it is
adjacent to the enemy unit. If it isn't, it will not melee.

4.0 COMBAT PHASES
During this phase, all fire phases and melees are resolved. Casualties are
taken.

4.1 Fire and Melee Phases
There are a total of five fire phases and one melee phase during a combat as
outlined below:

* Defensive Artillery Fire Phase
* Offensive Artillery Fire Phase
* Defensive Fire Phase
* Offensive Fire Phase
* Defensive Melee Fire Phase
* Melee Phase

Units will fire if they have a line of sight and are within range of the
target unit. Ranges of weapons are found on the Weapon Range/Casualty Table.
All fire phases are automatically resolved by the computer.

4.2 Advances and Retreats
Units will retreat and advance after combat automatically by the program.

4.3 Rout and Rally
Units will change to the rout shape and retreat when their morale breaks.
After they have rested they may rally and return to the combat shape. When
routed they may move only one square per phase by the player.

5.0 FATIGUE
A unit's fatigue rating is a measure of how tired it is. It gains fatigue when
it moves and takes losses. See the Fatigue Gain and Fatigue Recovery Tables
for details. Fatigue also affects morale.

6.0 REINFORCEMENTS
Each side receives reinforcements according to the Order of Battle.

7.0 HOW TO WIN
Players receive victory points. A score is calculated by subtracting the
Confederate points from the Union. You may examine the map and look at the
units of both sides when the game has ended.

7.1 Victory points
Players receive points based on enemy casualties according to the schedule
below:
* 1 pt per Infantryman lost
* 3pts per Cavalryman lost
* 150 pts per Artillery Gun lost

For Union only:
In possession of square
17,2  =  1000 (500 if in ZOC)
18,9  =  1000 (500)
21,14 =  1000 (500)
31,18 =  1000 (500)
25,3  =  1000 (500)
28,11 =  2000 (1000)
32,7  =  4000 (2000)
33,1  = 10000 (5000)

7.2 Victory Levels
The score is compared to the chart below:

Union Major Victory          = 6000+                          
Union Minor Victory          = 2000 to 5999
Draw                         = -1000 to 1999
Confederate Minor Victory    = -6000 to -1001
Confederate Major Victory    = Less than -6000

The Union may attain a major or minor victory only if he has inflicted at
least 5000 casualties on the Confederates. If he doesn't meet this
requirement, the Confederates automatically win at least a Minor Victory.


INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCED GAME RULES

1.0 INTRODUCTION
BATTLE OF ANTIETAM is a grand-tactical level game of the Civil War battle
centered at Sharpsburg, Maryland along the Antietam Creek. It has become known
as the bloodiest day of the Civil War.

1.1 Description of Action
Each game turn represents an hour of real time. The execution of a game turn
includes activation and rally, movement, mode changes, facing changes, and
resolution of artillery fire, offensive fire, defensive firem and melee.

1.2 Talking to the Computer
To select a routine from a menu or answer a YES/NO question, just press the
desired key.

1.3 Game Scale and Map
There are eleven turns in the game each representing one hour from 6:00AM to
5:00PM of September 17, 1862. The map is situated on a 42 X 36 square grid.
Each square represents 200 yards from side to side. The various terrain
depicted includes clear, town, woods, cornfields, fords, roads, streams,
rivers, and bridges. One to seven randomly placed fords may appear in addition
to the two historical ones. four elevations are represented by contour lines.
See Figure 1.4 below for terrain symbols.

1.4 Saving a Game
At the end of each combat phase, the computer will allow the player(s) to save
the game in progress. You will need a blank disk to store the saved game data.
Players must initialize their blank disk from within the program as offered by
the Save Game Menu. Once a game is saved, you may restart it at the point
where you left off. You may not change selected options when you restart a
game in progress.

1.5 Units
There are three unit types in the game: Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Each
unit is rated for manpower (guns for artillery), effectiveness, fatigue,
morale, weapon type, mode, facing, operation points, command control, rout
status, and disruption status. Units are represented by specific graphic
shapes depending on unit type and stacking. See Figure 1.5 below. On your
screen , Union symbols are blue and Confederate symbols are white. Note that
the symbols will change shape to reflect different facings. Each unit
represents about two to three regiments or one half of a brigade. A unit is
named after its brigade commander with an "A" or "B" designation attached.
Attached to units are divisional and corps commanders. the brigade commander
is assumed to be present at both A and B units of its brigade.

1.10 Parts Inventory
Your game should contain the following parts:

a. Game box
b. Rule book
c. One 5-1/4" game disk
d. One map card

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY

BATTLE OF ANTIETAM is a two-sided game: Union vs. Confederate. Both sides may
be played by either a human player or the computer opponent.

2.1 Determining Conditions of Play
At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under
which the game will be played from the menu below:

0. NEW GAME    SAVED GAME
1. LEVEL OF PLAY    1 2 3 4 5
2. UNION  HUMAN  COMPUTER
3. CONFEDERATE
     HUMAN  COMPUTER
4. BASIC  INTERMEDIATE
     ADVANCED
5. HIDDEN UNITS   NON-HIDDEN
6. TIMELIMIT   NO TIME LIMIT
7. COLOR TV   BLACK/WHITE
8. ACTIVATION  YES    NO
9. ICONS   SYMBOLS

Type"0-9" to make your choice and RETURN to continue. You will be asked to set
the delay loop for displayed messages in the game. Set it at 4 or 5 if you are
a beginner.

* The #0 option allows you to select a new game or continue with a game in
progress. When you select a saved game, the options on the menu are defaulted
to the options selected in your saved game. When you select the "SAVED GAME"
option and press RETURN, you will be prompted to insert your saved game
diskette and type in the name of the file (you will be allowed to catalog thw
save game disk if you wish). You may not change game options when you boot up
a saved game.

* The #1 option selects the difficulty level. Level 3 is Historical and makes
no modification to either side. Levels 1 and 2 favor the Confederate player
(level 1 more so than level2). Levels 4 and 5 favor the Union (5 more so than
4). Levels affect the casualties inflicted in fire and melee combat and also
the number of activations for the Union.

* Options #2 and #3 allow you to set the Confederate or Union player to be
controlled by a human or the computer. Please note that you may have the
computer play against itself for a demo game.

* Option #4 gives you a choice of three games of varying complexity. the
differences are explained under the appropriate headings of the rulebook. The
INTERMEDIATE Game is exactly the same as the ADVANCED Game except for the
deletion of leaders and command control and the addition of automatic
fortification rule.

* Option #5 allows you to play a game where only sighted enemy units of both
sides will appear on the map during the combat phase. Hidden units will also
become visible when moved adjacent to during the operation phases.

* Option #6 gives you the ability to set a time limit to how much time a
player has to complete his operations phase.

* Option #7 gives the black and white or monochrome user better suited unit
shapes.

* Option #8 gives you the choice of using the Activation rules or having every
Union formation automatically activated.

* Option #9 allows you to play with icons (figure profiles) or Symbols (bars).
Symbols are recommended for INTERMEDIATE and ADVANCED play since they show
facing and mode changes. Icons are automatically used for the BASIC game.

2.2 Historical Set-up
At the start of the game, the computer will assign all combat forces to their
locations the early morning of September 17, 1862 when J.Hooker launched his I
Union Corps against the Confederate line.

2.3 Sequence of Play for a Game Turn

 1. Activation Phase
 2. Command Control Phase
 3. Recovery/Rally Phase
 4. Reinforcement Phase
 5. Union 1st Operations Phase
 6. Union 1st Combat Phase
 7. Confederate 1st Operations Phase
 8. Confederate 1st Combat Phase
 9. Mid-Turn Recovery Phase
10. Union 2nd Operations Phase
11. Union 2nd Combat Phase
12. Confederate 2nd Operations Phase
13. Confederate 2nd Combat Phase
14. Victory determination Phase

3.0 ACTIVATION PHASE
 
The Union army commanded by George McClellan was slow to be committed into
action. Only when encouraged by the battle or hounded by his officers and
aides did he commit troops. Even though he actually out-numbered the
Confederates by 2 to 1, he believed the Confederates outnumbered him 2 to 1.
Even units ordered to attack lost momentum after an hour or so due to lack of
generalship of McClellan. Corps were orderedto the attack in piecemeal
fashion. The activation rules attempt to recreate these leadership factors. In
this phase the Union player is allowed to cycle through his various divisional
commanders on the map and activate those he wishes, up to the activation
limit.

3.1 Activation Cycle
The program will flash the cursor over Union units where a divisional
commander is present, inverse all squares that contain units of that division,
and prompt you to activate or bypass them. All Union divisions on the map will
be cycled through until you have activated up to your limit of divisions.

3.2 Activation Limits
You will be allowed to activate a base number of four divisions per turn with
a random number added to that. In addition, as your score goes up and the day
wears on, you will be allowed to activate additional divisions. Divisions are
activated on a turn by turn basis. Being activated one turn does not ensure
activation the next turn. When the computer plays the Union, it will follow
the restrictions placed on the Union player in the BASIC game (see 2.0 in the
BASIC game rules) instead of the limits listed here. In the IBM version, Union
cavalry units may not be activated until turn 3.

3.3 Activation Effects
Units belonging to activated divisions may move normally (assuming they are in
command control). Union Corps artillery units are activated with any division
of their corps. Unactivated units may not move, but may perform any other
actions up to their operation allowance. Union artleery CAV units are
activated with the CAV division.

3.4 Confederate Activation
All Confederate units are activated each turn.

4.0 COMMAND CONTROL PHASE (ADVANCED GAME ONLY)

During this phase, leaders and units execute a command control trace to
determine if they are in command control or out of command control. This phase
is skipped for the INTERMEDIATE Game, (All units are always in command
control).

4.1 Command Control Trace
Infantry and cavalry units make their command control trace to their
appropriate divisional leader. Confederate units must be within six squares
and Union units within four square of their divisional leaders to be in
command control. Units are also in command control if within one square of
their corps commander. Union artillery must be within six squares of their
corps leader. Confederate artillery units are automatically in command
control.

4.2 Divisional Trace
Divisional commanders must also trace to be in command control, divisional
commanders must be within six squares of their appropriate corps commanders
for the Union and Unlimited for the Confederate.

4.3 Automatic Command control
All cavalry units, cavalry artillery units, Confederate artillery units, and
units of the Confederate Evan's Brigade are automatically considered in
command control. Corps leaders are also automatically in command control.

4.4 Effects of command Control
Units out of command control have operation point allowances cut in half. in
addition, units out of command do not have ammo resupplied or disruption
recovered. They may not rally.

5.0 RECOVERY/RALLY PHASE

Units in this phase recover disruption and fatigue. they also receive ammo.
Routed units will rally if eligible.

5.1 Disruption Recovery
Units in command control have a chance of changing from disrupted to
undisrupted status. see the disruption recovery Table.

5.2 Rally
Units in command control will change from routed to normal status(Rally) if
their morale is 40 or greater, they are in command control, and they have more
than 100 men for Confederate and 300 men for Union.

5.3 Fatigue Recovery
Units recover fatigue at a certain percent of their effectiveness rating (see
Fatigue recovery Table).

5.4 Ammo Replenishment
Units out of ammo will replenish their ammo according to the Ammo Resupply
Tables at the beginning of the turn and at the Mid-Turn Recovery Phase.

6.0 REINFORCEMENT PHASE

Reinforcements are automatically put on the map at designated entry squares.
units are delayed if stacking would be violated or the entry squares are enemy
occupied. See Order of Battle.

7.0 OPERATION PHASE

During this phase players may perform a variety of actions including movement,
force marches, fire and melee plots, leader transfers, mode changes, and
facing changes.

7.1 Cursor Menu
In this menu the player may do the actions listed below:

(V)       = Prompts you to indicate a direction and then displays the line of sight.
(0)       = Centers map at cursor
(1-8)     = Moves cursor in desired directions
(T)       = Removes units from map to see terrain.
(S)       = Stops time clock.
(C)       = Exits to Combat phase(press this key when you are finished moving).
(SPACEBAR)= Accesses first unit in square if friendly. Command menu for unit that is now 
            active.

Also displayed is the terrain type, elevation, and X,Y coordinates of the
square.

7.2 Unit Statistics
When you access the first unit in a square, you will see the following display
(examples):

CONFED RIPLEY - A INF 501 MEN
DS:N AMMO:Y MEL:Y MRL:83 FIRE:17,34
NORMAL  OP:7 DIR:5 ADV:N ACT:Y   
ROAD(3)      X,Y:16,34

The display above shows that the Confederate unit, RIPLEY -A, is INFANTRY with
501 men.
It is not DISRUPTED, still has AMMO, is plotted for MELEE, and has a MORALE of
83. The unit is plotted for priority FIRE at square 17,34. It is in NORMAL
mode, has seven remaining operations points, is facing DIRECTION five, and is
not plotted for ADVANCE. It is ACTIVATED (Union only) and on a road square
with an elevation of 3. The unit occupies square with X,Y coordinates 16,34.
There is a compass showing directions of movement and facing. A second page of
unit statistics may be accessed by typing "P".

CONFED RIPLEY - A INF  501 MEN
FORT:0 NORMAL CC.IN
RFL EFF:83 FT:0
ROAD (3)   X,Y:16,34

The second display above shws that the Confederate unit, RIPLEY - A is
INFANTRY with 501 men. The unit has a FORT value of 0, is in NORMAL mode, and
is in COMMAND CONTROL. Its weapon type is RIFLE, EFFECTIVENESS is 83, and
FATIGUE 0. It is on a road square with an elevation of 3 on X,Y coordinates
16,34.

7.3 Command Menu
When a unit is accessed a number of commands are available. The commands can
be enacted by pressing the appropriate key in either page of the unit
statistics.

(0)    = Centers map on unit.
(1-8)  = Moves unit in desired direction as indicated by the compass changing  its facing 
         automatically
(X)    = Force March (adds to the unit more operation points at a cost of fatigue.)
(D)    = Prompts you to input a new facing (1-8) for the unit.
(L)    = (Advanced Game Only) Displays a menu with the name of the divisional or corps 
         commander attached and allows you to transfer that leader if you desire. The menu 
         also allows you to go to the divisional or corps commanders.
(I)    = All units that belong to the same division as the accessed unit will be inversed. 
         The square with the divisional leader will be inversed and blinking (Advanced 
         game).
(A)    = Plots the unit to advance if given the opportunity in fire phases or melee.
(M)    = Plots the unit to Melee in the direction of facing.
(F)    = Takes you to the Target menu which allows you to set a priority fire square.
(S)    = Changes the mode of the unit.
(B)    = (Advanced game only) Builds one level of fortification.
(V)    = Allows you to view all squares in the LOS of the accessed unit(squares are 
         inversed).
(T)    = Removes units on map to view terrain underneath.
(P)    = Displays the other page of unit statistics.
(H)    = Displays Help Menus
(U)    = Accesses next unit in the same square.
(N)    = Accesses next unit in the unit order.
(Z)    = Abort move, The unit you have accessed will return to its original square, 
         facing, and mode with its original operation points and fatigue.
(Q)    = Exits Command menu and goes to the Cursor menu.

7.4 Operation point Allowances/Costs
At the beginning of each operation phase units receive ten operation points,
unless they are out of command control in which case they receive five points.
Up to Two unused operation points are carried over to the second operation
phase of a turn, thereby giving some units 12 operations points to begin the
second phase. Some Confederate units receive 0 operation points for the entire
first turn. most actions require the expenditure of operation points that
differ with unit type. Refer to the Operation Costs table for a complete list
of the costs.

7.5 Moving a Unit
Once a unit is accessed it may be moved by pressing keys "1-8" in the desired
direction. Operation points expended to move depend on unit type, unit mode,
terrain of the square, and other factors (see Costs table). Units may always
move one square if activated at the cost of 5 operation points when out of
command control and 10 operation points when in command control. Units may
move as part of an advance during the combat phase without expending operation
points. The advance is allowed if plotted and the unit is otherwise eligible.
Units may not move into streams or rivers unless a bridge or ford is present
(and the unit is in column mode for bridge crossing). Artillery may not move
unless limbered. Units may not move onto enemy units or violate stacking
limits of friendly units. Press "Z" to abort if you have made a mistake with
the unit you are moving to put it back to its original place.

7.6 Zones of Control
The eight square next to a unit constitute its zone of control. Zones of
control affect movement costs per the Operation Costs table. Movement from an
enemy ZOC to another will cost extra operation points in addition to normal
costs and will be allowed if no other movement has been made by that unit (see
Costs Table). ZOC to ZOC movement is also allowed during advances in the
combat phase. Limbered Artillery may not move ZOC to ZOC. Routed units forced
to retreat through an eneny ZOC suffer losses and stop their retreat.

7.7 Stacking
No more than two non-artillery units may stack together. No more than one
artillery unit may be in a single square regardless of the presence of other
units. You may have a maximum of two non-artillery units and one artillery
unit in a square. Only one unit may occupy a town, ford, or bridge square.
Stacking shapes are dependent on what is in the square. All units in a square
assume the direction of facing of the last unit to end its turn on the square.
When a square is fired upon by non-artillery units or artillery at greater
than one range, casualties are distributed among the defenders with one of the
defending units receiving 3 times the casualties of the others. Artillery only
takes losses if in a square alone or fired upon by another artillery unit. A
square fired upon by artillery at a range of two or more will affect each unit
in the square. units in column receive the road rate only if the road square
being moved onto does not contain another unit. When routed units stack onto
friendly units each unit gains five fatigue points.

7.8 Unit modes
Units may be in one of two modes which affect movement and combat. Infantry
units may be in column or normal. Cavalry may be mounted or dismounted.
Artillery may be limbered or unlimbered. When a unit changes mode its graphic
shape on the map also changes. Changing modes requires the expenditure of
operation points as listed on the costs table. Unlimbered artillery may not
move. Units must be limbered, mounted, or in column to cross a bridge.
Dismounted cavalry has a .75 modifier applied against its strength
(horse-holders). Infantry in column, limbered artillery, and mounted cavalry
are considered to be flanked when fired upon from any direction.

7.9 Facing
A unit may have eight different facings from 1 to 8. Facing may be changed at
any time during the operations phase at no cost. facing automatically changes
during movement as a unit faces the square it is moving into. In addition, all
units in a square will assume the facing of the last unit accessed in the
square. All units in a square have the same facing. this way you may change
the facing of an entire stack by changing the facing of just one unit. Units
and stacks of units will assume appropriate shapes on the map to reflect their
facing. Facing determines a unit's line of sight. A unit has a line of sight
equal to 90 degree angle radiating in a V shape from the unit. See 8.3 for
further details on line of sight. A unit fired at through a direction not in
its line of sight is considered to be flanked.

7.10 Force Marches
A unit may receive extra operation points by force marching at a cost of
fatigue points on a one to six basis. Pressing "X" command will increase the
fatigue level by six and increment the operation points remaining by one.
Units with fatigue levels of 40 or higher may not force march.

7.11 Fortification
A unit may have a fortification value of 0 to 5 that modifies combat results
(See Modifier Table). Fortifications are built by pressing the "B" key at a
cost of operation and fatigue points (see costs table). Units automatically
fortify themselves when they have remaining operation points at the end of the
combat phase of the Confederate turn in the INTERMEDIATE game.

7.12 Leaders and Leader movement (Advanced game Only)
Leaders are assigned to specific units. Each leader commands a formation.
Formations are brigades, divisions, and corps. Leaders are organized into a
chain of command that must be updated when a leader is wounded. A corps
commander that is wounded will be replaced by one of the divisional commanders
in his corps. That divisional commander will be replaced by a brigade leader
of his division. Brigade commanders are assumed to be present at both units of
their brigade. They are not attached to a particular unit as long as they are
a brigade commander. Brigade commanders promoted to command a division act as
divisional commanders. Divisional and Corps commanders may be transferred to
any unit within their formation. Pressing "L" when a unit is accessed will
list any leader present and prompt you to transfer it. If you wish to
transfer, the cursor will cycle through eligible units. Pressing "I" will
inverse all units belonging to the same division as the accessed unit. The
location with th e divisional leader will blink. Each time a unit with a
leader takes caualties, there is a check to see if a leader is wounded. Each
leader has a combat bonus. A leader with a bonus of 20 will increase
casualties, inflicted by the unit it is with by 20%. See the Order of Battle
for each leader's bonus. Corps and divisional leaders are important to command
control. Divisional leaders affect the resupply of ammo. Brigade leaders
affect rally. When a leader dies, the unit it is attached to gains five
fatigue points.

7.13 Fire and Melee Plots
During the operations phase, units may plot priority fire, melee, and advances
if they wish to perform those actions during combat. To plot melee, press "M".
To plot advance press "A". For both these plots you may toggle between Y for
yes and N for no by pressing the appropriate command key. Note also that
plotting melee will automatically plot advance, as a convenience to the
player, since advances are usually desired in melee attacks. You may toggle it
back to N for no by pessing "A". An important note is that a unit will melee
only if it has also fired at the square it intends to melee. Plotting melee
automatically plots fire into the square directly in front of the unit.
Consequently, do not plot melee until after you have moved your unit. You may
melee a unit not directly in front of you by plotting melee and then
retargeting the fire plot. To plot fire press "F", which will display a menu
that will allow you to move the cursor to the target square and press "T" to
plot it. Pressi ng "V" will inverse all squares eligible to be target squares
and pressing "E" will return you to the command menu, inserting a "No Plot"
into the fire plot. A fire plot will only be accepted if the targeted square
is within range and in line of sight (see line of sight 8.3). A unit that
plots a melee will automatically plot the square directly in front for fire.
Units that are unable to execute their priority fire plot or units with no
plot will fire at the nearest enemy unit in range and in line of sight.


8.0 COMBAT PHASES
During this phase, all fire phases and melees are resolved. Casualties are
taken. Routs, retreats, and advances are all executed.

8.1 Fire phases
There are a total of five fire phase and one melee phase during a combat phase
as outlined below:

* Defensive Artillery Fire Phase
* Offensive Artillery Fire Phase
* Defensive Fire Phase
* Offensive Fire Phase
* Defensive Melee Fire Phase
* Melee Phase

Defensive fire phases are executed by the non-phasing player and offensive
fire phases by the phasing player. Messages will appear on the screen and the
map will scroll to fired upon units. Casualties and other combat results will
be printed on the screen.

8.2 Casualties
A unit inflicts casualties with its fire based upon a number of factors. See
the strength/casualties modifier tables to give you an idea of what the
factors are and what effects they have. Artillery units lose guns and fatigue.
They are eliminated when their gun count reaches 0. Artillery guns are lost
due to combat only when enemy artillery is firing upon them. In addition,
artillery takes fatigue losses from infantry fire, only if alone in the
square. An artillery unit will take gun losses and retreat in melee combat if
their fatigue exceeds 75 or if forced to retreat by the combat results.

8.3 Line of Sight and Range
In order for a unit to plot or even execute its priority fire plot it must
have a line of sight and be in range of the target. ranges of weapon types are
listed on the Weapons/range Casualty Table. You may view the line of sight of
any unit by pressing "V" when the unit is accessed in the command menu or
target menu or when in the cursor menu. There are four elevation levels on the
map representing 40 - 50 feet of elevation per level. Woods represent a 20
foot elevation obstacle, towns 30 feet, cornfields 6 feet, and units 5 feet.
In addition to the normal line of sight and range limitations, there is an
additional visibility limit built into each level. A unit at level 1 may see
no further than four squares, regardless of its weapon range or normal line of
sight. Eight squares is the limit at level 2, twelve at level 3, and sixteen
at level 4. these visibility levels will be proportionately modified downward
by the overall percent visibility of the battlefield.

8.4 Melee
To melee, a unit must be plotted for melee and be undisrupted. it will melee
into the square fired into if the square is adjacent. All units plotted
against the same square are added together as a group. Defending units in
melee have an extra defensive fire before melee is resolved. Units expend
operation points to melee. Units must have enough operation points to fire and
melee the same square, otherwise their melee is cancelled. See the modifier
tables and the Melee Combat Results Table for details.

8.5 Retreats
As a result of rout or melee, units may be forced to retreat up to four
squares. Retreated units will generally retreat away from enemy units towards
the rear of their lines. The rear of the Confederate lines is considered to be
the upper right corner of the map and the lower left corner for the Union.
Routed units suffer casualties and stop their retreat if thay have to enter an
enemy ZOC. Unlimbered artillery is forced to retreat when it gains over 75%
fatigue in melee. It will also retreat and take extra losses if so indicated
by the Melee Results Table. Friendly units retreated onto gain five fatigue
points.

8.6 Morale, Rout, and Rally
A unit's morale is equal to its effectiveness minus its fatigue. A unit with a
morale of less than 15 has a 40% chance of routing. A morale check is made for
possible rout whenever a unit takes losses. Units with less than 80 men will
automatically rout when they take losses. When a unit routs it retreats four
squares. It may move only one square per phase until rallied. A unit will
rally when its morale reaches 40 or more and it is in command control (and has
more than 100 men for the confederate and 300 for the union).

8.7 Advances
Units plotted to advance will advance in the combat phase if defending units
are retreated. Advancing ZOC to ZOC is allowed.

8.8 Disruption
Every time a unit suffers losses, there is a chance it will become disrupted.
A unit has about a 40% chance of becoming disrupted per 100 casualties. A
disrupted unit loses its priority fire plot. It may not fire except for
defensive melee fire nor may it execute melee plots. A unit has a chance of
becoming undisrupted at the beginning of the turn and at the Mid-Turn Recovery
phase. It chances and conditions for recovery are outlined on the Disruption
Recovery Table.

8.9 Ammo
Every time a unit fires it has a chance of running out of ammo.
Infantry/Cavalry have a 7% chance and artillery has about a 10% chance.
Casualties inflicted by a unit that runs out of ammo in that phase will be
greatly reduced. At the beginning of each turn and at the Mid-Turn Recovery
phase a unit may be resupplied with ammo if in command control (see Ammo
Resupply table). Units without ammo may not fire, but may melee at reduced
strength.

8.10 Fatigue
A unit starts the game with zero fatigue points. As it moves and loses
casualties it will gain fatigue (see Fatigue Gain Table). It also gains five
fatigue points when a routed unit stacks onto the same square or a leader
attached to the unit dies. fatigue has a proportional effect on fire strength.
Fatigue is subtracted from effectiveness to yield a unit's morale which
affects routs. A unit will recover fatigue at the beginning of the turn (see
Fatigue Recovery Table).

9.0 MID-TURN RECOVERY PHASE

During this phase units will check to recover disruption and resupply ammo,
according to the appropriate tables.

10.0 VICTORY DETERMINATION PHASE

during this phase, players are awarded points for casualties and territorial
objectives. After the eleventh turn (4:00 p.m.) is completed, the game ends
and the score is compared to the victory levels. You may examine the map and
access units of both sides after the game has ended.

10.1 victory points
Players receive victory points according to the chart below:
*1 pt per infantryman lost
*3 pts per cavalryman lost
*100 pts per brigade leader lost
*300 pts per division leader lost
*500 pts per Union Corps leader lost
*1000 pts per Confederate corps leader lost
*150 pts per artillery gun lost
ignore leader points for the intermediate game.


For Union Player only:

In possession of square:
17,2  =  1000 (500 if in ZOC)
18,9  =  1000 (500)
21,14 =  1000 (500)
31,18 =  1000 (500)
25,3  =  1000 (500)
28,11 =  2000 (1000)
32,7  =  4000 (2000)
33,1  = 10000 (5000)

10.2 Victory Levels
The score is calculated by subtracting the Confederate victory points from the
union and comparing the result to the chart below:

Union Major Victory = 6000+
Union Minor Victory = 2000 to 5999
Draw                = -1000 to 1999
Confederate Minor   = -6000 to -1001
Confederate Major   = less than -6000

The Union may attain a major or minor victory only if he has inflicted at
least 5000 casualties on the Confederates. If he doesn't the Confederates win
at least a minor victory.

11.0 STRATEGY AND TACTICS

Union Strategy:

The Union has two major stumbling blocks: Activation limits and the Antietam
Creek. You'll find that there is more than one approach for the Union army.
Some strategies may include advancing one division to each of the bridges
opposite Confederate positions on the first turn to secure them. Other
strategies may activate the Union I Corps and use them to charge the
Confederate middle or right flank. Still others may decide to keep the union I
corps inactive and bring additional divisions across the creek, waiting to
make a concerted attack. The success of the Union strategy will be based on
how well the confederate reacts with his reserves and how well each side
tactically deploys its armies. A good strategy with bungled tactics will fail
miserably.

Confederate Strategy

The Confederate is on interior lines and has flexible control over its
divisions. Although outnumbered 2 to 1, he can muster a 3 to 1 advantage
against the Union in localized areas of the battlefield. The Union I Corps is
usually a likely candidate to attack with the Confederate reserve divisions.
Counter-attacking the union when they are weak can be devastating. Be careful
not to overextend yourself. Let the Union come to you. Remember that the
advantage is with the defensive player.

Tactics

1. Well-placed artillery can be deadly. Put your artillery on a high elevation
or behind the lines with a clear line of sight.

2. When attacking be sure to counter battery the opposing artillery to make
them gain fatigue.

3. Avoid attacking and defending with units in column and mounted cavalry.

4. Place leaders with units in key areas of your attack or defense. Their
bonuses can really make a difference. Place them with units that have a lot of
men to lessen their chance of becoming a casualty.

5. Place units in a defensive line that asssures channels of retreat for
routed units.

6. Make sure you will have enough operation points to fire and/or melee.

7. Be aware that stacks of units with over 650 men will incur additional
casualties.

8. Use force marching judiciously.

9. Fortify whenever you are not in contact with the enemy.

10. Remember to keep routed units in command control when you wish to have
them rally.

11. Be careful not to have units plotted to advance "from the frying pan into
the fire".

12. When you attack, make it an all-out attack with reserves ready to exploit
it.
