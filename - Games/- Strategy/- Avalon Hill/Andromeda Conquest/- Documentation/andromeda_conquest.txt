INTRODUCTION
------------
ANDROMEDA CONQUEST is a game in which 1 to 4 players compete to form
galactic empires.  These empires are formed by establishing new colonies
in far flung star systems and then defending them.  The first player to
hold len systems for an entire turn wins.

The game is played on a vast scale.  The galaxy itself is made up of 12 to
48 (depending on the number of players) star systems.  Each star system has
unique attributes, such as strange life forms and often technologies, that
make interstellar exploration exciting.

As emperor of your respective species, you will have to consider your
resources.  Each player begins the game with a home planet and ten resource
points.  As the game progresses, players accumulate more resources from
their colonize.  More resources mean faster expansion is possible and defense
is easier.

Encounters with other players are always a problem, especially if a star
system is desired by two or more empires.


SCENARIO
--------
Two events occur simultaneously which put you in charge of your species
destiny; the development of a faster than light star drive and your rise
to emperor of your star system.  It is now for you to decide how to expand
and protect your empire.  Types of starships to build, destinations of ships,
and diplomatic relations with other empires are all problems that the
emperor must decide.

As you expand, some star systems will have inhabitants that must be
conquered before colonization can take place, while others will be
uninhabited.

COORDINATES
-----------
In order to find your location, the galaxy is divided into coordinates.
Coordinate numbering starts in the upper left corner of the galaxy with 0,
A flett of the upper left corner of the galaxy would be at X and Y coordinate
of 0,0.  As a fleet moves from left to right across the screen, its "X"
coordinate will become greater.  Similarly, as a fleet moves from the top of
the screen towards the bottom, its "Y" coordinate increases.

HOME SYSTEMS
------------
At the beginning of the game each player is given a star system to call his
own.  This is done of random so it is possible for two players to have home
systems adjacent to each other or to be separated by the entire galaxy.

Each home system is given ten resource points and all players have a
technology of 6 and pliability index of 5 (see below).

STARSHIP TYPES
--------------
There are three types of starhips; NOVA, ECHO, and RAMA.  Each has unique
qualities.

   NOVA ships are large star cruisers that are fast and have a lot of
offensive power (war power).  Nova ships have the ability to destroy star
systems.  When a system's defenses are reduced to zero or below and you have
a Nova ship of that system, the computer will give you the option to
obliterate that system.

   ECHO ships are large colonization vessels that are slow and have no war
power at all.  They are completely defenseless by themselves.  Expensive, but
not as expensive as Nova ships.

   RAMA ships are small military or escort vessels.  They can travel very fast
and have a small amount of war power.  They are very cheap to build and
therefore will probably form the backbone of most space navies.

LIFE-FORMS
----------
Each player is given the opportunity to choose his own life form.  No life
form has an advantage over others.  Player life forms are used to identity
players and their colonial possessions.  As the player expands into the
galaxy he will encounter other life forms, some belonging to other players
and some neutral.

SYSTEMS
-------
Star Systems have certain attributes that the player should be acquainted with.

   System I.D.: A number to the right of the system that identities it.
   Type: Refers to the magnitude of the star.  Types range from zero (Blue
         Giant) to Nine (White Dwarf).  The closet a star type is to the type
         of your home star, the easier it will be to colonize that system.
         This also means that a system will have a different colonization cost
         for each player.

   Life: The life form that inhabits the system.  This will change if the
         system is colonized.
   Technology: The technology level of the inhabitants.  This value ranges
               from zero to nine.  All players have a technology of six and
               can conquer life forms with technologies up to seven.  Systems
               with technologies of eight of nine are unconquerable.
   Pliability: An index that shows how much the inhabitants can be pushed
               around.  A low value indicates sissys.  A high value indicates
               John Wayne cultures.
   Defenses: The sum of the technology and pliability index for that systems.
             If this value falls below one the system is open to colonization
             or destruction.
   Resources: The number of resources that the system will be worth if
              colonized.
   Colony Cost: The cost to create a colony in the system.


THE GAME TURN
-------------

1. Allocation of Resources
   The player receives resources from all his star systems including his
home system.  Resources are not transterable to other turns; any unused
resources from the turn are lost.

   The first choice a player must make is whether to establish a colony
(see establishing a colony).  If the player answers YES to the "ESTABLISH A
COLONY?" prompt, the computer will produce a readout titled "ECHO REPORTS".
This report is a summary of all star systems that have at least one of your
Echo ships in it.  Information provided by the Echo Report for each star
system will include the systems I.D. number, number of resources, and the cost
in resources it will require to colonize it.  The computer will then ask
"WHAT SYSTEM?".  Enter the I.D. number of the system that you want to colonize.
If you don't want it, can't afford it, enter a 0 to continue your turn with
no loss of resources.  It is only possible to establish one colony per turn.

   Next you must allocate the remainder of your resources for ships and
defenses.  If you try to use more resources than you have, the computer will
start the allocation procedure over again.  Note it is only possible to add
defenses to one system per turn.


2. FORMATION OF SPACE FLEETS
   The player must now form fleets with ships he has built with his resources
(if no ships were built, this part of the turn will not appear).  Fleets can
be launched from home or any colonized system.  You can form any number of
fleets from available ships, but the total number of fleets for your empire
can never exceed nine.  If you try to create more than nine fleets, you will
lose all the ships not yet assigned to fleets.

3. FLEET COMMANDS
   This is the main part of the players turn.  It is entered with the question
"FLEET CONTROL WHAT FLEET ?".  Enter the number (TRS-80: letter) of the fleet
you wish to command.  If you have no fleets, enter any number (TRS-80: letter)
and your turn will end.

   There are eight Fleet Commands that the player may select from:

   1. Tactical - A tactical display from the fleet you are currently commanding
                 showing stars, colonies, your fleets (displayed as their I.D.
                 number or letters), and alien fleets (displayed as an # on the
                 TRS-80, Atari and PET, an A on the Apple and an IoI on the
                 IBM).  Empire colonies are represented by an asterisk with
                 the I.D. number to the right of it.  See next page for example
                 of tactical display.



      EXAMPLE OF TACTICAL DISPLAY
      ---------------------------

                                          :
        Friendly Star Systems ------> *27 :     6 <----+------ Friendly
                |                \        : /----------+       Fleets
                |         : : : : *5: : : 3 : : : A : : : :
                +-------------> *48       :        \
                                          :         \
                                          :     A -------  Aliens


   2. Strategic - A view of the entire galaxy.  Your colonies are shown with
                  their I.D. numbers to the right of the star as in the
                  Tactical mode.  Empire fleets are numbered (lettered on the
                  TRS-80) as in the tactical display.  No alien systems or
                  fleets are shown.  This display is very helpful in deciding
                  strategy.

   3. Attack - Command used to attack system defenses or alien fleets.  See
               COMBAT for more details.

   4. Probe - If your fleet is in orbit around a star system or at the same
              position as an alien fleet this command will produce a readout
              giving information on the system or alien fleet.  If you fleet
              does not meet appropriate requirements for a probe, the
              computer will respond with "PROBE NEGATIVE."

   5. Navigation - Command used to move your fleet to a new location.  The
                   computer will give you a navigational display showing the
                   magnitudes (types) of the stars in the fleet's vicinity as
                   well as locations of friendly and alien fleets.  The
                   navigation display is useful in choosing stars with
                   magnitudes approximating that of your home star.  Stars
                   with magnitudes close to your native star will require
                   less resources to colonize.  Input your moves by utilizing
                   the grid displayed on the monitor screen.

                          Atari, PET,    7  8  9               1  2  3
                        TRS-80 & IBM:    4  5  6       Apple:  4  5  6
                                         1  2  3               7  8  9

                   It is possible to leave the galaxy!  You won't find any
                   stars out there though.

                   Your fleet represents the center of the grid.  If you wanted
                   the fleet to move up one space you press 8.  To move the
                   fleet one space up and to the right press 9.  To end
                   navigation press 5.  Once you have ended naviagation, the
                   fleet cannot move again, even if it has movement points
                   remaining.

                   Rama ships can travel 5 moves per turn.  Nova ships 3 moves
                   per turn and Echo ships 2 moves per turn.  Fleet maximum
                   speed is that of the slowest ship in that fleet.  Therefore
                   a fleet with 5 Ramas could travel 5 moves per turn, but a
                   fleet with 5 Ramas and one Echo could travel only 2 moves
                   per turn.


   6. Join Fleets - This will allow you to join two of your fleets that are at
                    the same location.  Enter the numbers (TRS-80: letters) of
                    the placed into the first fleet entered.

   7. Fleet Control - Use this command to pass control to another fleet.

   8. End Turn - Passes play to the next player or to the next game turn.


COLONIES
--------
In order to establish a colony at the beginning of a turn, the player must
meet three conditions:

1. The player must have an Echo ship in the star system to be colonized.
2. The system to be colonized must have zero or less defenses.  Colonization
   cannot take place if the system is defended by natives or by another empire.
3. The player must have sufficient resources to meet the cost of colonization.

Once a colony is established the resources of the colony can be used on
subsequent turns, ships can be launched from it, and resources can be
allocated to build defenses there.  Many star systems may be very poor in
resources but make excellent military bases for further exploration.  All
colonies belonging to your empire will show your life form and technology (6)
if probed.

COMBAT
------
There are two types of combat that can take place in ANDROMEDA CONQUEST.  One
is an attack against an alien fleet, the other is an attack against star
system defenses.  In both types of attack, no losses are ever incurred by the
attacking fleet.  Losses to the defender are computed by a random number
between 1 and Attacking Fleet War Power divided by 2.  Only fleets can attack,
system defenses cannot.  If the defender is an alien fleet, losses are taken
in ships, not war power.  Therefore, a Nova can be as easily beaten as a Rama
when it is the only ship in a fleet.  If the defender is a star system, losses
are taken in defense points.  Any ships orbiting the system are unaffected
unless attacked seperately.  If all defenses are eliminated and the attacking
fleet contains a Nova ship, the star can then be destroyed at the option of
the attacker.

COMBAT vs. MOVEMENT
-------------------
A fleet that moves during a turn may only attack once after moving.  If the
fleet does not move on that turn, it may attack twice.  A fleet that first
attacks may not move afterwards even if it only attacked once.


GALACTIC MAPPING GRID
---------------------
For your convenience a mapping grid log pad has been provided (under the
plastic tray) for your use.  Star systems and fleet locations can be recorded
on this pad.

MULTI-LAYER GAMES
-----------------
To win in a multi-player game, a player must control 10 star systems for one
entire game turn.

SINGLE PLAYER GAMES
-------------------
The object in a single player game is to colonize the ten required star
systems in as few turns as possible.


CASSETTE LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

ATARI 400/800
-------------
Lift the cartridge door on your Atari 400/800 computer and insert the
COMPUTING LANGUAGE BASIC cartridge into the computer.  Use the LEFT
CARTRIDGE slot on the Atari 800 system.

Press the Power switch on the side of the console ON.  With side one of the
cassette up, put it into your Atari Cassette Recorder and press 'REWIND'
until the tape stops moving.  Using the keyboard, type:

                  CLOAD

and press the RETURN key on the keyboard.  You will hear one beep.  Push
PLAY on the recorder and press the RETURN key on the keyboard again.  The
recorder should start to move and the program will load.  After the program
has been loaded the recorder will stop and the READY prompt will reappear,
Type:

                  RUN

and press the RETURN key.


APPLE II
The Apple program is located on Side One after Atari program.  By listening to
the tape, you can tell the difference between the two programs.  The Apple
program is easily recognized by the relatively high pitch and pure quality of
the calibration tone at the beginning of the program.  This tone is free of the
characteristic Atari buzz.  Find the beginning of the Apple program and
position the tape to just after the start of the calibration tone.  Set up the
recorder for input.  On the keyboard, type:

                  LOAD (Don't hit RETURN yet)

Press PLAY on the recorder and immediately press RETURN on the keyboard.  The
computer will start reading in your program.  The computer will beep twice,
once at the beginning of the program and once at the end.  When the program
has loaded, the computer will print READY.  Type:

                  RUN

and press the RETURN key to play the game.


TRS-80
The TRS-80 program is located on Side Two after the PET CBM program.  By
pulling out the EAR and MIC jacks on the recorder and listening to the tape,
you can differntiate, the PET program from the TRS-80 program.  The PET
sounds louder, yet has a lower pitch.  Check that the volume control is set
to the proper level (between 5 and 6 is normal).  Press PLAY on the recorder,
and type:

CLOAD (for Mod III only, enter: L after Cass ?  prompt, then CLOAD)

and press the ENTER key on the keyboard.  The recorder should start to move
and your program will be loaded.  This will be indicated by the flashing
asterisk at the upper right corner of the screen.  When the tape stops and
the TRS-80 prints READY on the screen, type:

                   RUN

and press ENTER to play the game.


COMMODORE PET CBM
Turn the tape over to Side Two.  Insert the tape in your recorder and rewind
to the beginning of the tape.  When ready, type:

                   LOAD

and press the RETURN button on the keyboard, then the play button on the
recorder.  The tape should start moving and start loading your program.  The
computer will tell you when it finds the program and starts loading.  When
done, the computer will print READY, and the tape will stop.  Type:

                   RUN

and press RETURN to play the game.


DISKETTE LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

APPLE DISKETTE
ANDROMEDA CONQUEST is designed to play on your Apple II with Applesoft.  To
play, insert the disk into your 3.2 or 3.3 disk drive and boot the system.
