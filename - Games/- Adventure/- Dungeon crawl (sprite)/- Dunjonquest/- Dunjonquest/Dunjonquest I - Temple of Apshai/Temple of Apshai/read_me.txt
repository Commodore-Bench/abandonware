Temple of Apshai is considered one of the first graphical role-playing
games for home computers, predating even the commercial release of
Richard Garriott's Akalabeth. It was an enormous success for its era,
selling 20,000 copies by the end of 1981, and 30,000 copies by 30 June
1982 and remaining a best-seller for at least four years.

Temple of Apshai is the first title in Dunjonquest, a series of
single-player, single-character fantasy role-playing games by Automated
Simulations (later known as Epyx). Temple of Apshai was the most
successful and most widely ported game in the series.

The second Apple II release of Temple of Apshai (r2) added an animated
intro of a knight beheading a giant ant, featured improved graphics, and
some sound effects. This release featured an "Old English" font, and the
controls are sligthly different from the original. Instead of keys for
turning left and right, the game uses absolute directional keys instead.

A third release (r3) allowed players to choose between the "Old English"
font and the standard font.
