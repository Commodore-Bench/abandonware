What respectable castle doesn't have a minotaur pit to throw meddlesome
thieves into? And you might just be mistaken for one of those thieves.

This is one of the earliest Eamon adventures, written by Donald Brown
just after the original Beginner's Cave. It is a good example of the
style of the first adventures, circa 1980. It's one of the simpler
adventures, without too many special effects. That said, it does have a
few creative touches: a boat you can use to travel on the river, and
some content that depends on the gender of your character.
