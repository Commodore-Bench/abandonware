The adventure begins with gossip at the Main Hall concerning "rumblings"
in Marewood Forest alerting the adventurer to a new opportunity for an
excursion. The introduction continues by suggesting that upon exploring
the forest, the adventurer discovers tracks in the earth and gets lost
following them before being dragged underground by a mysterious pair of
hands. The lack of oxygen in the underground tunnels beneath the forest
causes the adventurer to lose consciousness and, after waking, the
adventurer must explore the underground lair of a villain known as the
Mole Man.

Assault on the Mole Man takes place in underground caverns below
Marewood Forest, described as "a few miles outside" of the Main Hall.
