John Nelsonâ€™s best adventure. The adventure is broken-up into three
different environments, the temple, the cave, and the intriguing
dimension of dreams.

Loaded with special effects, unusual situations not normally found in
Eamon and interestingly hidden items (just using a LOOK command will not
reveal all). Even when the solution is known, luck can still play a part
in the carrying out of the final triumphant acts.

The difficulty is mostly in the problem solving rather than
survivability. Moderate characters and above should be able to complete
this adventure, although it may take a couple of tries.
