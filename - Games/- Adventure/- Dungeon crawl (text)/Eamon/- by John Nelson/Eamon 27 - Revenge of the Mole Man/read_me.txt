Your old nemesis, the Mole Man, is back, and this time he has abducted
an entire village. Not just the people. The entire village. Off to
Marewood Forest to see if you can find the Mole Man's lair once again.

This adventure is a sequel to Assault on the Mole Man, written by John
Nelson, a prolific Eamon author from the mid-1980s and one-time head of
the National Eamon Users Club. It's mostly a dungeon exploration, with a
few decoy monsters, a couple keys and secret doors to find, and one big,
well-executed special effect.
