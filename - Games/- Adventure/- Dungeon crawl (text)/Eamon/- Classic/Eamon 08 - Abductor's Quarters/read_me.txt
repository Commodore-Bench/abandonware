This is an early Eamon by Jim Jacobson, author of Cave of the Mind. It's
a rescue mission in a dungeon run by a renegade adventurer with a taste
for abductions and torture.

This adventure has a couple nifty special effects. There is one cursed
item. You also need to find something special to be able to light the
lantern.
