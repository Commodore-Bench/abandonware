You have been sought out to aid your two friends (from Thror’s Ring,
#114), Gorim the Dwarf and Galehir the Wood Elf, in the rescue of the
High-Elf, Fromir. Fromir’s wisdom is a vital asset to the forces of good
in Middle-earth, but he has been seized by Orcs and imprisoned in Dolni
Keep.

Despite the fact that this adventure has a small number of rooms,
uniform monsters (orcs), and a reduced command list, it is a real treat
to play. This is not a hack-and-slash adventure but a realistic
treatment of the rescue theme. It plays more realistically then most
Eamon adventures.

Your com[anions offer comments which add an extra touch of realism and
imbue them with a personality not usually accorded to non-player
characters. You may check their health, inventory the items they are
carrying, or request objects from them. They each have special skills
and the ability to switch weapons in combat.
