While lounging about in the Main Hall, two newcomers (an uncommonly fair
high-elf and dingy-robed wizard) approach and proposition you.

‘I represent sponsors of a forth-coming expedition into the abandoned
mines of Moria,’ the wizard states. ‘There will be a worthy quest,
fabulous loot and incredible danger. Dost thou have interest in such an
adventure?’
