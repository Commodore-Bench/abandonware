And now for something completely different!

The Monty Python-inspired classic. Join King Arthur and his band of
knights as you search for the Holy Grail. Fight the fearsome Black
Knight, seek out a shrubbery, and beware death itself, with nasty,
pointy teeth. Nee!

A favorite for any Monty Python fan, this adventure is entertaining,
very descriptive, humorous and follows the movie enough that you should
catch some clues if youâ€™ve seen it.
