 In a remote world, once upon a time, a group of teachers all signed a
 document (legally binding) vowing chastity, poverty, and obedience.
 This document was entrusted to one of the teachers, who put it in a
 'safe place'. Somewhat later, he left to take another teaching
 position, and the other teachers have been unable to contact him. A
 political group is searching the school for the document in order to
 use it to intimidate the teachers.

 Adventurers should realize that in this world violence is frowned upon.
 Therefore, your only weapon is an unabridged dictionary and all battles
 are verbal. You need to remember to 'scold' or 'lecture' your
 opponents.
