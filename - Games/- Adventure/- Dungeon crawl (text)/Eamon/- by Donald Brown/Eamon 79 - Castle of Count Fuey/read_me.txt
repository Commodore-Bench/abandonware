This is one of Brown's best Eamons. It is not a complex play, but is
simple like most early Eamons were. But there is a "Tournament" time
gimmick taht greatly heightens the tension. Every move gives you a time
elapsed, and the adventure must be completed in a time limit.

The timings are nicely done. You get a readout to the second, and the
timings seem reasonable for the moves made. You are scored at the end of
play. You get points for each GP of loot, plus bonus points for the
three things you were tasked to recover.

The "90 minutes" of play generally took me about a half-hour. I was not
successful in rescuing Tanya on my first attempt, but just made it in my
second (the map is a set piece and does not vary from play to play). She
is hidden magically and was difficult to find.

Two hints: EXAMINE is an important command. And be sure to watch for
unusual characteristics in the descriptions.
