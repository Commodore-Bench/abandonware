You are looking for a mighty quest, when you find a dying elf who speaks
of dragons and great treasure. Can you challenge the Last Dragon and
survive?

This is an adventure originally written by prominent Eamon author Roger
Pender. It's a large adventure with a number of elaborate special
effects, including a cave that has four different incarnations, which
may be different every time you play. It's really two adventures in one:
finding and dealing with Vincingotrix, the Last Dragon, and taking the
optional additional quest of defeating the Dark Lord Sauron. Roger drew
inspiration from both the Lord of the Rings and the works of Richard
Wagner.

If you're going to give this one a try, make sure to bring a seasoned
character and your best magic sword. The combat can be very tough,
especially in the early going when you don't have any companions. But
there's lots of gold as a reward.
