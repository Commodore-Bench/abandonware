While passing through Camelot, you learn that disaster has befallen the
kingdom. Morgan le Fay, the sorceress and King Arthur's half-sister, has
stolen his magical sword, Excalibur!

This is a well-written adventure by prolific 1980s Eamon author Roger
Pender. It has a well-constructed castle with many rooms and artifacts
to find to complete the puzzle. There is combat galore, but most of the
monsters aren't very hard, except one. Better find a way around the
dragon without fighting, or you'll be toast.

SwordQuest is one of the better designed puzzles in Eamon, and it got
consistently high ratings from reviewers back around the time it was
written. Give this one a try!
