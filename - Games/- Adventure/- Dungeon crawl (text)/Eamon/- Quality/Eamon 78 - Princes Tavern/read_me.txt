This is one of the most creative and fun Eamon adventures ever written.
The king of a neighboring country sends you into the tavern of his
no-good son, the prince, to find a valuable bottle of 600-year-old
Scotch. Once inside, you encounter many colorful denizens and strange
magic powers.

This adventure is notable for its many creative special effects,
including a drinking contest and numerous whimsical, creative, and
dangerous traps. A couple new spells add to the plot, including a LOCATE
spell that helps you find items and people, once you manage to learn it.
The storytelling is vivid and interesting throughout.
