You accept a mission to track down a band of smugglers operating out of
a nearby town. You quickly realize you're in way over your head.

This is a very competently done Eamon. If you like your Eamons to play a
little differently every time, then you may get several good plays from
this one before it starts to get old for you. One hint: remember your
spells.
