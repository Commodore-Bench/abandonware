Marvel Fanfare published old comics that had been made but never
published before, for whatever reason. This issue, #33, brings to light
the conclusion of the Questprobe comic series starring the X-Men.
Presumably when the fourth game in the series got cancelled, the comic
got tossed into the vault as well, only to resurface later here. At
least we get some closure to the overall story.
