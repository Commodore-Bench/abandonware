Ultimore Adventure #1: A World Divided

Sometime in late 1984 with the release of Ultima 4 a year off, I saw an advertisement in the back of A+ Magazine selling new scenarios for Ultima 3 by Backstreet Software. These scenarios were called "Ultimores", I recall there were four of them, along with another set of 4 scenarios for Wizardry called "Wizimore". These were not sanctioned scenarios but rather the product of Joel Fenton, a one man operation out of Iowa.

I was intrigued and given a single scenario cost all of $10, I ordered the first scenario, A World Divided, and soon received a floppy in the mail. Given it's the same game engine and mechanics as Ultima 3, it only took me a weekend to run through and complete.

That being said, it was super fun and very cleverily done. I highly recommend playing if you're an Ultima fan. I only wish I would have ordered the other 3 scenarios as well for posterity's sake.

Included also are the one page sheet of instructions to provide background on the scenario.
