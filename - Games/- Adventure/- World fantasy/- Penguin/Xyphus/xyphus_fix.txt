Xyphus Fix

   When the (ineompletly) softkeyed copy of Xyphus (COMPUTIST No. 24, pg,
14) is used to make a player disk, the game will drop into BASIC rather
than rebooting. This is because Xyphus jumps to the address stored
in the reset vector after copying the pillyer disk. To make it reboot
instead, DOS must be told to point to the reset vector at $C600. 
   To fix this, start up your sector editor and change track $0, sector $D,
bytes $52 and $53 to $00 C0 (previously $32 A2). This change can be
incorporated into the Xyphus Controller by changing the following lines:

5000 DATA 7  CHANGES
5060 DATA 0, 13, 82, 0
5070 DATA 0, 13, 83, 198

This will make Xyphus rebooT as it should.
