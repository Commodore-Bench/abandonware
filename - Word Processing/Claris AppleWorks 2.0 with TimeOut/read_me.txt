AppleWorks 2.0 (c) 1983-88 Claris Corp.

This is the edition of AppleWorks 2.0 that was sold by Claris after it
was spun off from Apple Computer (AW 2.0 was originally released by
Apple in 1986)

It shows "Copyright CLARIS Corp. 1983-88 V2.0 USA" on startup

By contrast, the earlier Apple edition has "Copyright Apple Computer
1983-86 V2.0 USA"

Despite appearances, they are essentially one and the same

AppleWorks 2.0 is not Y2K compliant and won't accept any year beyond
1999 when inputting the current date

NB: This version has been patched for TimeOut and will prompt for a
TimeOut applications disk.  If you don't have one, bypass this step by
pressing ESC.

The TimeOut menu can be invoked at any time with "Open-Apple-ESC"
