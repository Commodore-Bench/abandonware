Oregon Trail is the longest-published, most successful educational game
of all time. Three student teachers, Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and
Paul Dillenberger, created The Oregon Trail in 1971 on a teletype
printer, to help Minnesota schoolchildren learn American History.

When Rawitsch joined the Minnesota Educational Computer Consortium
(MECC) in 1974, he brought along the code for the game and MECC
developed a version for distribution to schoolsâ€”first in Minnesota and
then around the United States. The game has been widely available ever
since, appearing on every major computing platform, from mainframes to
smartphones.

Oregon Trail is the oldest continuously available video game ever made,
and pioneered a blend of learning and play that showcases the valuable
contribution games can make to education.
