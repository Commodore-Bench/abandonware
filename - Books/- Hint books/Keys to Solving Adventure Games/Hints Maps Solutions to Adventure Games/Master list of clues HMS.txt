To determin~ the direction to which you should point the mirror, recall the basic principle of physics, namely, the angle of incidence equals the angle of refection. Thus, in this room, since light enters from the southeast and you want to go southwest: point the mirror south. Continue to do this as you wind your way through the underground rooms, i.e., set up a continuous path of light from the entrance all the way to the Treasure Chamber. Along the way you will encounter a junction of underground rooms which requires you to make a decision as to which way to head. There is no way of telling which is correct, so just hope you are lucky. It's a good idea to save the game here. Since the mirrors (being bubbles in reality) will pop after a finite time, be very efficient with your moves.
