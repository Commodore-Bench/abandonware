AppleDOS v3.2 System Master Standard and
AppleDOS v3.2 System Master Plus 

by: Apple Computer

Requested by: nobody in particular

I was going through my old diskettes and found these.  I thought someone
might be curious.

If you purchased your Disk ][ between June 1979 and July 1980, these are
the two system master diskettes that you would have received.  The 
"standard" version was intended for an integer ROM Apple ][ while the "plus"
version was for the Apple ][+.

Both of these diskettes are still in their original 13 sector format and 
therefor are both .nib images (thanks to SST) :).  To boot either of these
diskettes, you must first start AppleWin with the DOS 3.3 master and then
"BRUN BOOT13".  Replace the disk image with a DOS 3.2 master and press 
return.  

The major difference between v3.2 and v3.3 is allowing 16 sectors per track
that increased the capacity of a diskette from 113.75K to 140K.  The upgrade
kit included a ROM chip that had to be swapped in your Disk ][ controller to
accomplish this.  In addition there were a number of bug fixes in the new
version.

Please rename to DOS32STD.NIB.GZ and DOS32PLS.NIB.GZ and
save to /pub/apple_II/images/masters.
