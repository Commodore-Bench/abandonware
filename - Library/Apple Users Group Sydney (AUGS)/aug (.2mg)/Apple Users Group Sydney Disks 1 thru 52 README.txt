APPLE USERS' GROUP (SYDNEY)

*** DISKS 1 - 52 ***

This collection comprises the first 52 disks produced by the Apple Users' Group of Sydney in the 1980s, with a wide assortment of Apple II programs.

They originally came supplied on 5.25" floppies in DOS or ProDOS format.
  
I used ShrinkIt to create disk archives of the complete set, backing them up to 3.5" 800K ProDOS disks (seven in total).

The archives are denoted by S1 for side 1 of a 140K disk and S2 for side 2.

Most are in DOS 3.3 format and may need 8-bit ShrinkIt to unpack.
