APPLE II GAMES - SOFT DOCUMENTATION COLLECTION
----------------------------------------------

Around 120 softdocs archived on two 3.5" ProDOS disks

Something I had put together in 1991.  ShrinkIt, needed to unpack the files, is included on the bootable disk A-L.

(CiderPress for Windows supports ShrinkIt format and may be used to view the softdocs directly as they are mostly just AppleWorks or text files)
