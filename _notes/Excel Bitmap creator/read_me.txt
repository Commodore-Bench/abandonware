An Excel Spreadsheet to virtually create and render Apple ][ bitmaps/sprites.

Works with MS Excel, Libre Office/Open Office Calc.

Fill in Apple ][ hires screen bits on a spreadsheet to create reusable bitmaps and sprites for your Apple ][ software development.

Use the copy/paste features of your spreadsheet software to easily create pre-shifted shapes.

The spreadsheet

•	renders the bitmap as a real Apple ][ (or more precisely like an emulator),

•	computes all the bytes values (so you can copy/paste them in your program)

•	generates POKE commands to type in Applesoft so you can see how it renders in your favourite Apple ][ emulator.

Instructions are included in the spreadsheet.
