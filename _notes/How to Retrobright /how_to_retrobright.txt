Get the salon 40 [see picture] and some OxyClean. 

Put the salon 40 into a container you will either be “painting” from or “dipping into”

You can add water to dilute the salon 40 down to 10% if you have delicate stuff like the keys from a keyboard. If it starts off as 40% then diluting it to 10% just means add 1 cup of salon 40 and 3 cups of water. 

After you get the strength figured out start adding a teaspoon at a time of oxyclean and stirring it in until it just starts to foam. 

A little foam is good. It helps it stick if you’re painting. But if you add too much it will foam over the sides and just be wasted.

You might also want to heat the salon 40 in the microwave before adding the oxyclean. If it’s hot the oxyclean dissolves better. Get it hot hot, but not so hot it burns your skin. 

I think the dipping method gives the best most even results. 

But for large pieces you might have no choice but to paint it.

Oh. And if you want to play with thickening agents, you can do that too. Something like corn starch or whatnot. 

Treat it like a gravy. Put a 3-4 tablespoons in a cup and mix with cold water. 

Once it’s completely mixed pour corn starch mixture, into the (nearly boiling) mixture of salon 40 and stir immediately.

Good thickening agents are xantam gum and arrowroot. William’s posts are just right. - Javier A. Rivera

Sorry Jav. I forgot the name of the ArrowRoot powder. 

The idea is that the starches in the powder, when heated, bind into long chains, and thicken the mixture. The goal being to make the mixture stick the parts a little better so they stay wet at all times.

Go for the strictly liquid version, not the cream. Use the immersion method. It requires less attention from you and is far less likely to give you a mottled or streaked result. - Brad Geels



By the way, the "40" on the bottle does not mean it is 40% peroxide. It is 12%.

I would also start on something small first to build some confidence
