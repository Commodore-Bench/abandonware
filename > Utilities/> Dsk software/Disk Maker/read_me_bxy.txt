What is bxy file? How to open bxy files?

BXY is the format currently required for new uploads to the Apple II
libraries of GEnie and Compuserve. These files can be created and
unpacked with ShrinkIt. Although this "envelope within an envelope"
format may seem redundant, it has several advantages. Ideally, the
Binary II envelope will be entirely "transparent" to end users - it will
be automatically added by telecommunications software during uploading,
and automatically removed during downloading. As more telecommunications
programs come to support automatic Binary II packing and unpacking, this
ideal will be increasingly realized. Thus, if your telecommunications
software supports automatic Binary II unpacking during downloading, you
can turn this option on when downloading a .BXY file. Doing this will
give you a downloaded file which is a "bare" NuFX archive. Thanks to the
Binary II envelope, this file will automatically be given the correct
name and filetype.
