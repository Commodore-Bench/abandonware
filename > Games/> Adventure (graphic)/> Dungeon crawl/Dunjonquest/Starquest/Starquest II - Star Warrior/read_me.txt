Star Warrior is closer to a strategy game than other Dunjonquest titles,
although the player still controls only one character. The player takes
the role of a "Fury", an assassin who uses highly advanced technology
and wears an exoskeleton. The game offers the choice between two maps,
each with an individual mission. The first mission is to cause as much
destruction as possible, as a distraction to prepare the assassination
of a military governor. The second mission is to carry an assassination.
As a first among Dunjonquest and related titles, the game takes place in
outdoors areas.
