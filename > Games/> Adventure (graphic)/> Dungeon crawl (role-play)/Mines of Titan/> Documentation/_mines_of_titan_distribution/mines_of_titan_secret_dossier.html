<p>
Summary of the Joint Controllers Meeting: 5/29/61, 0700-1300
<p>
1) Combined infopaks from all Controller offices were mashed through
computer central in search of unusual events in and around Proscenium
recently. Initial search proved inconclusive.
<p>
2) Recovery and analysis of infopaks from office of Hal Yu, Controller
of Proscenium, were finally accomplished via Paramount HQ's override
of deep core security. Sifting after mash produced the following 
relevant points:
<p>

<table width=90% border=0>
<tr><td>
A. A large tunnel complex 6 kilometers SSE of Proscenium's Alpha
Adit was discovered 5/13/61 by miners. From their report to 
Controller Wu; "The walls of the tunnel were quite smooth,
almost as if manufactured, and there was a logical 
layout to the tunnels that must have been created by someone
-- or something -- intelligent. We began mapping the tunnels
as best we could. There are many levels and they seem to go
on forever. After three hours of exploration, we entered a
large room where we encountered an unknown Titanian creature.
The thing was huge, about 4 meters high by 3 meters wide and
deep. It seemed to vibrate as we drew near, but did not otherwise
move. We had little time to explore the creature because we all 
began suffering massive headaches that throbbed in time with the
creature's vibrations. Sketches of the tunnel system were lost
during the hasty retreat."<br><br>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
B. Beginning the  day after the discovery of the tunnel complex,
Proscenium miners began to report sightings of new Titanian lifeforms.
According to Controller Yu's infopaks, these new creatures were unlike
any encountered before. All were discovered to be predators and were quite
difficult to kill. Several more sketches of these new creatures were scanned
into Yu's report to Paramount HQ. It was noted that this report was not
made available to the other Controllers.

<p>
3) With the approval of Paramount HQ, the Controllers were granted access
to the private infopaks of all citizens and visitors on Titan. In particular,
they sought all maps of caves and tunnels not recorded in the central core.
Only one such map was located: a rather extensive cave system near Primus,
drawn by a spelunker. Several unknown species have been sketched on the rough
maps.

<p>
4) A search of descriptions of rare Titanian creatures turned up the enclosed
medical report, describing the autopsy of a "jelly balloon." Controller Wrak
of Primus pointed out that no further sightings of this creature had been made
since the autopsy. The doctor's final speculation that this creature might be
capable of intelligence was forwarded to Paramount Mining HQ, Geneva, for
further evaluation.

<p>
5) As a stop-gap measure to control panic amoung the population, the Joint
Controllers issued a statement that all communications with Proscenium had
mysteriously stopped.

<p>
6) The Joint Controllers decided to pass on all information gathered to the
office of the President of Paramount Mining, Inc. Transfer of data was accomplished
by coded radio communications.

<p>
7) The Joint Controllers recessed until new orders are received from the
company headquarters.

<p>
<center><b>Dissection Report</b><br><br></center>
1. The digestive system of this unknown creature (nicknamed "Jelly Balloon") resembles
that of most other Titanian creatures. The heat generator nodule connects directly to the
water storage nodules and to the food conversion nodule (i.e., liver). Solid and liquid
wastes are trapped inside special bubbles and are probably excreted as the creature moves.

<p>
2. The reproductive cell contains DNA-like strands. Unable to determine if creature 
reproduces by meiosis or by procreation. A pseuodopod could be used to deposit sperm
inside a female... if there are two sexes, as in other Titanian species.

<p>
3. The simple neural network found in all other Titanian animlas is missing form this
creature. Indeed, at first examination, this specimen doesn't seem to have a brain. However,
closer examination reveals a highly developed cell network enclosed in elastic
cartiledge (called a "notochord" in diagram); hundreds of bubbles, small and large, connect
to the central notochord.
<p>
This is pure speculation, but an argument could be made that this is the creature's 
neural network and brain system. Perhaps these bubbles are the creature's brain cells.
If so, the creature has a huge barin as compared with other Titanian creatures. Indeed,
as measued by total volume, its brain is much larger than a human brain. Except that
the creature is protoamoeboid in shape and therefore unable to use tools, I would 
venture to suggest that it could be intelligent.
<p>
A pity they didn't capture the Jelly Balloon alive. Wouldn't it be wonderful if these
things turned out to be as intelligent as a whale or a chimpanzee?

The Office of the President<br>
31 May 2261

<p>
You idiots!
<p>
Of course those "jelly balloons" are intelligent! Our biolabs ran a simple
Shoenfeld Test on the information you supplied us and came up with a 73%
probability that the creature you chopped up is sapient! Why didn't you
morons perform your own test?
<p>
Also 100% probable, in my opinion, is that native Titanians don't take 
lightly to having on of their own minced up by barbarians like us. Perhaps
by now it's penetrated your thick kulls that the Titanians are responsible
for the "mutants and monsters" that destroyed Proscenium! That big creature-thing
found in the tunnel complex near Proscenium may be the cause. Our brave human
"colonists" are going to be decimated by the Titanian "natives" protecting
their homelands.
<p>
This is a public relations nightmare! The Second United Nations have been after
us for years to "spread out assets among the Fourth World Nations." Now you've
handed every one of our enemies, competitors, and rivals a stick to beat us
into the ground! Titan -- and SOL-R-GARD -- are lost to us!
<p>
Well, it's time to form our own circle of wagons and cut bait while there's time.
As much as I'd love to leave you idiots there to stew in your own juices, it's
more important to save the reputation and future of Paramount Mining, and
that means I've got to bail you out.
<p>

<b>Here's exactly what you are to do:</b>
<p>
1. Download the computer core onto disks and get them aboard the fastest
transport you can find. Forward the disk to Geneva headquarters. All other
Paramount Mining, Inc. files and company records must be saved. I hereby
give you permission to commandeer every form of space transport on Titan
for this purpose.
<p>
2. Destroy all physical evidence you've gathered. There must not be a 
shred remaining to connect us with this disaster. Cornie Wrak, my dear
nephew, I'm warning you especially, because your memory lapses have
been so notable in the past.
<p>
3. Shut down all mining operations on Titan. Perhaps we can at least 
delay another disaster this way.
<p>
4. To avert suspicion from us, offer a reward to the first man to 
discover why communications went down with Proscenium. Thank havens,
the speeder system to Proscenium was not yet operational when this
disaster occurred. You might get one or two fools brave enough to
walk to Proscenium from Parallax, but they won't come back. This
should buy us time.
<p>
5. As much as I would like to order the general evacuation of Titan,
it is simply not possible. Saturn is in a poor position in its orbit
relative to our other bases, and so transport ships will be few and far
between for the next 18 months. I suppose, for the sake of the Paramount
Mining chain of comman, I'll have to allow you clown off Titan with the
company files... much as I'd love to let you suffer the same fate as
those innocent civilians. Cerese station will be alerted of your expected
arrival in five months.
<p>
I want you off Titan in three days. Get cracking!
