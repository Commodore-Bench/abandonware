<p>
It was hard to keep my mind on what Cornellius Wrak, the
Controller of Primus, was chattering about, when my whole
life was in ruins.
<p>
It was all so unfair--how little things add up. A tiny
pebble no bigger than my thumbnail--a speck from the
rings of Saturn!--had blown a hole in the main fuel
tank as my supply ship entered the upper atmosphere
of Titan. Normally, the sealant would have plugged
the hole, but the feed line to the outer hull shuts
down during final entry. So there I was, blowing my
fuel reserves inot space. What else could I do but 
jettison the cargo? Would they have been happier if
I lost the ship <i>and</i> the mine equipment?
<p>
But they blamed me fore the loss and forced me to
hock my ship to pay for the equipment. My insurance
company said they'll have a claims adjuster check
things out as soon as possible. Probably a year or
two. Yeah. Right.
<p>
So here I am, stranded on Titan.
<p>
"You've worked with use before, Mr. Jetland," Wrak was
saying as he sudied my file on the monitor. "We can
always use a person with your skill in the mines."
<p>
"Anything else available?" I asked. I'd become a Nomad
roaming the frozen Titanian surface before I sold my sould
to Paramount Minining, Inc.
<p>
"There's always free-lance bounty hunter," Wrak said with
a smile, clasping his fat fingers together over his mound
of stomach. "As a matter of fact, we do have rather an 
unusual situation here on Titan. We've lost contact with
our newest project, the city of Proscenium. Because of the
gravity of the matter, we Controllers are offering a handsome
reward to the first party who discovers why the comm-links
went down. Enough credit to reclaim your ship from customs.
Sound interesting, Mr. Jetland?"
<p>
"Seems simple enough," I answered. "I'll do it." I started to 
rise from my chair, but Wrak's frown made me hesitate.
<p>
"if it were simple, we wouldn't be offering so large a lump
of credits," he said with a sneer. "You'll need assistance 
getting to Proscenium... and more than a little luck. Personally,
I doubt if you have the intelligence or the intestinal fortitude
to succeed. Titan is no paradise."
<p>
He reached into the drawer of his vast desk and flipped a small
pamphlet at me. "A present, Mr. Jetland," he said. "Our Visitor's
Guide to Titan. My last copy, I'm afraid, and a bit tattered. Welcome
to Titan, Mr. Jetland, and a good hunt to you."
<p>
Leaving his office, I wondered if Wrak meant I was to be the hunter...
or the hunted.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<i>Mines of Titan</i> is a role-playing adventure set in the 22nd
century on Saturn's moon, Titan. In this role-playing game, you
create and control a party of characters exploring the satellite.
You develop youor characters by improving their natural attributes
and by adding new skills. Undertaking special missions during the
game allows your party to build up the credits (the monetary exchange
system on Titan) they will need for training and for purchasing more
powerful weapons. To win the game, you must discover why contact
with they city of Proscenium has been cut off. Success depends upon
competence in combat, using your character's skills to their best
advantage, and tracking down the clues to solve the mysteries of Titan.
<p>
The sealed envelope in the package contains information you may discover
on your own during play. <B>DO NOT OPEN THE ENVELOPE UNTIL DIRECTED TO
DO SO BY THE GAME!</b>

<p>
<H2>Characters</h2>
You start of the game with Tom Jetland seeking recruits in a bar on
Primus, the first city built on Titan. Not many people will want to
join the party initially, but as your reputation grows, more recruits
will become available. Recruits can be found in barracks, bars,
restaurants, and lounges. Examine their backgrounds, interview them,
and inspect their skills and attributes. A broad combination of skills
and attributes is important for a successful party.
<p>
Characters gain <i>experience</i> through combat and successfully 
completing assignments. Gaining experience is import for improving
skills and attributes. Also, <i>credits</i> (the medium of exchange
on Titan) may be needed to improve a character. Credits are gained
by selling items, gathered from dead foes. Bounties are listed at
Police Stations and gambling occurs in Casinos.
<p>
When a character gains enough experience to raise a skill, you will
be prompted with a message "So-and-so is eager to leanr" when you
inspect the character.
<p>
A dead character will remain with the party until dropped off at
a police station or bar, barracks, lounge, or restaurant. You can
tranfer items from a dead character until he or she is dropped off.

<p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
The characters in your party start off with certain
human attributes -- intelligence, strength, agility,
and so forth -- at various levels. The levels of
these attributes can be raised in Personal
Development Centers and Universities if a character
has sufficient credits and experience.

<p>
<h2>Attributes Depicted at All Times</h2>

<p>
<b>Might:</b>
A measure of a character's strength, this attribute
determines what weapons he or she can carry. Stronger 
characters can carry heavier weapons.

<p>
<b>Agility:</b>
A determination of accuracy and speed, agility is 
the most important attribute since it determines
the number of moves a character receives in a turn
of combat as well as the accuracy of ranged combat.

<p>
<b>Stamina:</b>
How much physical punishment a character can take
before performance is affected depends on his or
her stamina. Once stamina is depleted, a character
loses might and agility.

<p>
<b>Health:</b>
This attribute is the average of a character's
agility, might, and stamina.

<p>
These attributes are represented on the screen
by horizontal bar scales. Pay attention to the
Health bar at all times. A green bar means the
character is at full potential. If the bar reaches
zero, the character is dead. In <i>Mines of Titan</i>,
dead is dead nothing can change this.


<P>
<H2>Attributes Determined by Inspecting a Character</H2>

<P>
<b>Wisdom:</b>
This attribute reflects perception and intuition
Higher widsom may give a character an edge in
different situations.

<P>
<b>Education:</b>
This is the ability of a character to learn
academic skills. The level of this attribute
may limit how much a character can learn in
a field, such as medicine.

<P>
<b>Charisma:</b>
This attribute indicates not only a character's
good looks but also his or her charm and ability
to convince others to do what you asked. It is
very helpful in avoiding unwanted confrontations.

<P>
<b>Sex:</b>
Male or female. Sex has no effect for game purposes.

<P>
<b>Age:</b>
The current age of a character. Older characters begin
with more experience than younger ones, but they usually
lack the might and stamina.

<P>
<h2>Skills</h2>
Characters you recruit will have different skills at
different levels. For example, a recruit from the
police department will have some skill in wearing
battle armor and using handguns. Skills can be added
and increased. Some, such as gambling, are increased
through experience alon. Other skills can be enhanced
at various places on Titan (for example, at a Combat
Training Center, University, or Computer Center) if a
character has the credits and is ready to learn.
<p>
While a large party is more noticeable and may attract
more foes (possibly more vicious ones), its size also 
allows you to have "specialist" -- for example, someone
highly adept at medical skills or a highly trained programmer
who can dig deep into the system to discover important
information. A large party of inexperience characters
may often prove ineffective and may also draw unwanted attention.
<p>
<b>The following skills can be acquired or improved:</b>

<p>
<b>Administration:</b>
The ability to persuade people - especially
authorities - often comes in handy.

<p>
<b>Arc Gun:</b>
This combat skill is used with weapons that spray
chemicals or chemical fires in controlled arcs.

<p>
<b>Automatic Weapons:</b>
This combat skill is used with automatic weapons.

<p>
<b>Battle Armor:</b>
A character must be trained in a variety of 
ways to use servo-assisted battle armor.

<p>
<b>Blade:</b>
This combat skill is used in hand-to-hand combat
with all types of blades, from switchblades to
short swords.

<p>
<b>Cudgel:</b>
This combat skill is used in hand-to-hand combat
with handheld weapons, such as bats, lead pipes,
and rubber hoses.

<p>
<b>Gambling:</b>
The better a character's gambling skill, the more
he or she knows about the rules and odds of the game.

<p>
<b>Golum:</b>
Golum armor is used mostly by elite police forces and
requires special training. Each suit is specifically
modeled and tuned for its user.

<p>
<b>Handgun:</b>
This combat skill determines how well a character can
load, aim, and fire all types of hadguns. The better
the skill, the more powerful the handgun a character
can carry.

<p>
<b>Medical:</b>
With all the dangers on Titan, it's wise to have at
least one character proficient in this skill. A higher
skill level allows a character to purchase advanced
healing items, which are particularly useful when no
hospital is nearby.

<p>
<b>Melee:</b>
This combat skill is used in hand-to-hand combat with fists.

<p>
<b>Mining:</b>
Because Titan is a mining colony, most inhabitants have some
skill in this area. Better miners may detect unsafe passages
in mines and may be able to assist in cave-ins.

<p>
<b>Programming:</b>
The better a character's computer programming skills,
the more he knows of computer systems and how they
work - and how to hack more deeply into the system.

<p>
<b>Rifle:</b>
This combat skill is used with all types of rifles. The
better the skill, the more powerful the rifle a character
can use.

<p>
<b>Street:</b>
A character's street-wise skill is often useful in 
talking thugs out of combat.

<p>
<b>Throwing:</b>
Throwing items (knives, grenades, and so forth)
and projectile weapons (bows, grenade launchers,
and so forth) are covered by this skill.

<p>
<h2>Items</h2>
While attributes and skills reflect a character's
capabilities, <i>items</i> are equally important
to a party. Each character can carry up to nine
different kinds of items. Often a characters can
carry more than one of an item type. For example,
a character may be able to carry 10 grenades as
one item and the also carry eight other kinds of
things. Carried items are listed on each character's
summary.
<p>
Your party can also possess object and information 
in addition to the items they carry. Such objects can
be examined by using the Preferences menu.
<p>
Weapons can be bought and sold at Munitions Stores,
and more powerful arms can be acquired as combat skills
are raised. Vac-suits (necessary for exploring the
surface) and armor are available at Armories. Repair
Shops will pawn any times your characters have collected
and are also excellent sources of information and gossip.

<p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
You select the level of complexity for combat. You can let
the computer run the whole show or you can control each
character's movement and target selection (this is know
as tactical combat). When first playing the game, you may
wish to let the computer run several combats so you can 
study what is involved. Eventually, you will want to take
control because, even though the computer plays out battles
to the best of its abilities, the tactics it selects may be
quite different from the ones you would select in a given
situation.
<p>
Characters and their opponents act simultaneously, giving
combat a life-like feel. If the computer is controlling
the combat and you don't like the way it runs your characters,
press the spacebar. Control of the combat will revert to
you on the next turn.
