Apple ][: Might and Magic II [Games/RPG]

This is yet another standard 16-sector format game that uses disk volume
numbers for disk side identification.  I haven't made it far enough in
the game to verify that the volume numbers of disks C, E, and F are correct,
but I think they probably are.

Disk A: Volume 193
Disk B: Volume 194
Disk C: Volume 195
Disk D: Volume 196
Disk E: Volume 197
Disk F: Volume 198

The NIB images have been formatted with a descending skew factor of 2 to
speed up disk access.

Thanks to Thomas Lai for the (protected :-) originals!
