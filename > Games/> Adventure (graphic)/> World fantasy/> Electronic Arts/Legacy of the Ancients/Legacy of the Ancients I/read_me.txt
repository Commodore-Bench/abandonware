The game makes use of a code-disc copy protection that requires the
player to match a gemstone and the name of a world on which another
branch of the Galactic Museum exists. The player then has to enter a
six-digit number to proceed. One of the worlds on the disk, Bantross,
became the setting for the sequel, The Legend of Blacksilver.

Another part of the copy protection involves an attempt by the program
to modify the program disk itself on startup and render it unusable. On
authentic game disks, this operation fails since the disks are
write-protected. When playing the game using an emulator, it is
advisable to set the read-only attribute for each disk image to avoid
this modification.

This game shares a similar design to Questron. Although not a sequel, it
uses an updated engine shared by Questron and Questron II, and the
same developers worked on the games.
