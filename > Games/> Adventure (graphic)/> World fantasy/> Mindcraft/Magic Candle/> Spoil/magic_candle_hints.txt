    Since we've seen some recent interest in this game and I have received
a few email requests for hints, I thought I would upload my note/walkthru
file! <and just remind you <again, I know I'm getting to sound like a
record> that if you were a member of Portal, this file and MANY MORE would
have been at your finger tips!!! <sorry about that!!!>
