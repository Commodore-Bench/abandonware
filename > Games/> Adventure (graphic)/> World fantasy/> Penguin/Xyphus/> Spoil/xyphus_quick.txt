Disks

Xyphus1 is the Boot Disk.
        Volume #254 (write protected)

Xyphus2 is the Scenario Disk. This disk is
        never used for playing the game.
        Volume #2 (write protected)



Playing Xyphus

1. New Game

Boot Xyphus1. To start a new game select choice "A" from
the startup menu and follow prompts. Use the XySave Disk
as your character save disk. (For another player to play
the game with his/her own party, make a copy of XySave and
let the new player use the copy to create a save disk. The
game program will overwrite it with the new player's
characters.)

When the game is finished creating the character save disk,
you can swap in Xyphus1 and boot the game.


2. Regular Start

Boot Xyphus1. Select choice "B" to continue your game. When
the program asks you to insert your "existing game diskette",
insert your XySave disk.



Moving Xyphus to a Real Apple II

You can transfer the Xyphus1.dsk disk image with no problem.

Xyphus2.nib should first be disk copied to a .dsk disk image
using a whole disk copier such as Disk Muncher or COPYA. Name
the .dsk copy "Xyphus2.dsk". Transfer Xyphus2.dsk to a diskette
INITed for Volume 2-- e.g. INIT HELLO,V2

There is no need to transfer XySave.nib. (On a real Apple II,
the game can create a save disk on any regular 5.25" diskette.)

If you have a XySave.dsk disk image with characters you want to
transfer, follow the same procedure used for transferring 
Xyphus2.dsk, except transfer to a diskette INITed for Volume 3.
