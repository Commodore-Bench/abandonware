Shard of Spring FAQ/Walkthrough
Version 1.0.0

This FAQ is copyright 2000 Andrew Schultz and is part of my effort to 
preserve the memory of old Apple IIe games.  I am not affiliated with 
SSI in any way.  Please do not repost for profit without my permission.  
However, if you ask me in a nice note referring to me by first name, 
I'll probably give you permission.  Thanks!

This neat little RPG sort of grew on me despite being a prequel to 
Demon's Winter(a game I thoroughly loathed, but I can see some of its 
good points now) and so I thought I'd leave some notes on it if anyone 
was curious and wanted to play(or re-play) through it.

INTRO

I don't have a coherent one yet, and I haven't found a manual I have 
permission to quote from.  So all I can say is, you're trying to rescue 
Ymros from Siriadne.  You'll need to work through a few dungeons, find 
some special items, and whomp the guy.

This walkthrough describes the puzzles.  It doesn't really describe how 
to build a character, since I cheated my guys up to the max stats 
immediately.  But building you characters up is not the main part of the 
game, as there are only a few critical fights.

LOCATIONS(right and down of origin on my fortunecity map)

Format for towns describes every shop in it--where one weapon is 
mentioned, it's the best you can buy there.  Bars have no comments after 
them.

ITEMS

The table below should describe every item completely.  Each item has an 
unidentified name when you originally find it.  It also has a cost(you 
can't sell weapons back, alas!) and the #2 column has a strength-to-
wield(or, if it's a magic item, spell # which I haven't deciphered.)  
The #3 item has a magic charge quotient for combat items(i.e. extra 
damage or armor class,) and seems related to spell strength for other 
items, and the #4 item has base damage/protection for combat items and 
spell points contributed(which affect probability of success) for the 
potions, etc.

MONSTERS

The chart below should be self-explanatory.  SPD=speed/movement, HIT=hit 
points, ICO=the icon # that appears, EXP=experience divided among living 
party members, and MAGIC=magic points.  There are some other traits in 
the data file for the monsters, but I don't know what they're for, so 
they weren't included.

Gold received seems in my best guess to be a linear function of 
experience.  However, sometimes there seems to be a multiplier, 
especially on Islanda.  Please, however, forgive me if I patently refuse 
to run statistical tests to back myself up on this matter.

MAPS

Most of the dungeons in this game are pretty easy to figure out.  There 
are only three branchings, or there is a secret door that is revealed in 
the taverns.

The < and > indicate that the map cycles.
s=secret doors

Key:  ! is where you want to get to.

CAPITAL LETTERS indicate teleporters.
LOWER CASE indicate where teleporters go, i.e. A goes to a.

NOTE:  the "a" square is also the "m" square.
The transporters are numbered/lettered in the order I saw them, pretty 
much.

TAVERN TALK (BY CITY)

Greenhaven: You hear that a priest has been kidnapped and is being held 
prisoner in Blackfort by Devir the Destroyer. Blackfort was built in the 
forest southeast of the river by Galin the Good, but taken over by 
Devir.
Arcania: A muscular dwarf with big, beady eyes says he was attacked by 
Shamblers, horrible swamp monsters made by performing ancient magical 
rituals on dead swamp matter molded into human form..."
Precious Plains: A woman from east of the mountains says that she has 
been terrorized by Edrin, a powerful friend of Siriadne's. She overheard 
two men saying there is a secret passage in the corridor on the second 
level
Spider Bay: The Arena is fine if you are a fighter, but a wizard need go 
to Terynor for his training. Terinor is nestled in the mountains far to 
the northeast and is rich in magical items.
Woodhaven: The gate leading into Siriadne's fortress is magically bound 
and cannot be opened.
Gleon: A greying old wizard sitting by the fire is talking about magical 
staves. He says there are five kinds, one for each of the 5 elements of 
Fire, Metal, Wind, Ice, and Spirit. They are rare and powerful artifacts 
indeed...
Terynor: You hear a whisper from behind you: 'A band of rebels that 
despises the evil Siriadne has taken refuge in the hills to the 
southwest'
Janthrin:  NONE
Athe: A gnomish wizard is talking about elementals: unnatural, magical 
beings summoned by great wizards. They are five: one for each element. 
The Fire elemental is a being of pure fire, the Spirit elemental is 
mystical and feared.
Myrquacid: An ancient looking elvin wizard in the corner beckons you. He 
tells you in a shaky voice the second word in the name of the Ancient 
spell: 'Reveli'
Oceana: Years ago Islanda was ruled by the evil Moonglow family. Because 
of them the land is still terrorized by evil monsters. Eldron Greyhair 
ended thier reign and still holds a great treasure for adventurers on a 
worthy mission.
Atlantis: * Coming soon * From the makers of The Shard of Spring ... an 
adventure set in the midst of a greater evil...
Triton:  NONE

WALKTHROUGH

This walkthrough is short enough that it can be presented in list format 
without getting too long.  One thing I like about this game is how close 
you can get to the end without actually solving any puzzles.

  BLACKFORT

---You start off going south.  There's a key if you take the east 
passage and take the first door you see.  It'll allow you to go east.

---There's a priest held captive by the cul-de-sac that circles around 
the pool(the east door on the north.)  You'll have to fight a hill 
giant, who won't be too tough.  It's not immediately necessary to rescue 
him, but it is important for near the end of the game.

---In the southeast corner, a scrap of parchment indicates where you can 
find Devir.

---[spoiler below]

---The secret door is two south and one east of the door to the key 
room.

---Fight Devir and get an important item, the Royal Seal.  It will help 
you explore the basement in Edrin's Keep, which isn't necessary for the 
game, but it's fun.

  LAIR OF THE SWAMP KING

---Explore a bit.  Make sure you can beat the Shambling Mounds with 
relative ease.  There's a pool to the west that will heal your 
characters.

---To the east, there are some clues.  One tells of a secret door.

---Enter the secret door, win the fight, and get the king's head.  It'll 
come in handy later.

  EDRIN'S KEEP

---First, you'll need to find the copper key.

---It's just north and east of the entry, in a small room behind a 2x3 
room.

---You might want to pay attention to what the fighters have to say.  It 
will come in useful.

---You'll need to go downstairs.  If you don't have the royal seal, take 
a look above to see where to get it.

---You can use the copper key as follows--when the passage behind the 
door branches off to the left, follow it and go north at the first 
opportunity.

---Bingo, the silver key!  Search around a bit to find what it 
unlocks...

---...right, the first door on the RIGHT.  Hmm, now where's that gold 
key for the gold door?

---If you were a barfly you'd know.

---At one of the bars, you are told that there's a secret passage to the 
east of the corridor.  It is in fact three south of the right turn-off.  
Once you've found the gold key, you can defeat Edrin.  He leaves plate 
mail, which probably isn't too terribly useful.

  TUNNELS IN THE HILLS

---These aren't necessary since you are just looking for information 
here, which can be found later in this walkthrough.

---Note that the entry passage wraps every nine squares.  Well, there's 
a bit more to this dungeon than that.  You might guess that there's a 
secret door, and you'd be right.

---The secret door happens to be four east and three south of the exit.  
For your reward you get to find another secret door.

---And so forth.  Spoiler below.

---4 S, 4 W, 2 S, 4 W, 3 N, W leads you to the main room.

---You need a special item for the statues to talk to you.

---Go kill the swamp king if you haven't.

---Take note of what the statues have to say.  One of them says 
something very important.

---This isn't necessary for the game, but it's fun.

  THE TOMBS

---These are not strictly critical for solving the game as their main 
benefit is information, but they're neat and sort of flesh out the whole 
world.

---In fact, you don't even need to visit the four bad guys.  You just 
have to give Edrin the correct answer.  The item you get isn't 
*NECESSARY* for solving the game, but it doesn't hurt.

---Murthin, Cercion, and Vandiguard have normal tombs--nothing fancy.  
Just go in and fight them.

---There's a maze of invisible barriers in the tomb to get to Lothian, 
which would be troublesome if it weren't so small.

---A quick way to get through it is to go, from the square below the 
exit, 3S 2W 2N 2W N 3W S 2W N 2W S 2W N W gets you to the door of 
Lothian's burial chamber.

---There's a shortcut to Edrin's from Oceanus.  Where it looks like two 
islands join, you CAN walk across them.  Save yourself the grief.

---Answer Edrin with MURTHIN, CERCION, VANDIGUARD, and LOTHIAN.  He'll 
give you a storm ring.  He'll politely tell you to get going if you try 
to double-dip :).

  GATE KEEPER'S TOWER

---There are a bunch of teleporters in this one.  Map very carefully.

---C'mon, give it a try before I reveal a total spoiler!!!

---Okay, I'll trust you :)

---Well, here's an opportunity for you to check my work :P

---Hit the first teleporter.  EEN to 2nd, NNN, WWWN, SSS, EENNN gets you 
to the room with four teleporters.

---You can save the game before entering one, and I won't tell on you.

---Well, it's the lower left one you want to get to the distant isle.

---Be sure to stop in at the town before entering the dungeon!

  SIRIADNE'S

---This is the dungeon west of Myrquacid.  You'll want to go through the 
north gate, and you'll see you're on the island of fire.  Enter the 
castle(not much else to do...)

---Gee, it looks pretty peaceful.  A forest, a statue, and a gate.  Not 
the worst place to be stuck in if you saved your game and don't know how 
to progress(and WARNING:  you WILL get stuck if you're not sure what to 
do next.  Although you can disband your party, of course.)

---"Hey!  What's going on with the gate?"  It can only be moved by 
magical means.  Not a magical item, either.

---You must get the two words of the ancient spell for this to work.

---One is found in the hills.

---The other is found in a town.

---Myrquacid.

---Time to hang out at the tavern which, like all the others in the 
game, is nice and non-alcoholic.  Is this a Social Statement on the part 
of the authors?

---Total spoiler below:

---"DAZA REVELI" just south of the gate will open it.  Now for the main 
part of Siriadne's castle.

---There is only one real fork, although the passages wind a lot.  
You'll want to go east first.

---Search the side rooms.  In one you'll find something about a word of 
command.  Once you do, go back and go north.

---There are a lot of fights, but eventually you'll seem to pass through 
a wall(where having read about the word of command comes in handy) and 
you'll want to wind up with the Forcefield Key(the crystal bar when 
unidentified.)  Past the wall there are two fights--a bunch of undead, 
then Ralith himself for the key.

---Then go back and go the other way.  If you feel a need to get out, 
the paper dove/raven you defeat casts a teleport spell.

---You'll have to defeat one of each elemental on the way.  They are, in 
order, metal, fire, wind, ice and spirit.

---When it seems you're stuck, there should be a place with four gems to 
touch--blue, blue, red and green.

---Remember the fighters' song from Edrin's keep(the one they sing even 
after you've killed them?)

---The color pattern will help you.

---Blue, blue, red, green.  Poof, you're on your way...

---Have the little chinwag with Siriadne.  Then, YOU WIN!  Enjoy the 
ending.

  ENDSCRIPT SPOILER WITH OTHER GAME SCRIPTS

      ******ENDSCRIPT******

A cool breeze blows through the huge arched windows of the tower room. 
On an ivory pedestal lies the object of your quest: a knife-shaped piece 
of green crystal.
As you hold the shard and look out over the landscape of Ymros, it looks 
beautiful and peaceful; more peaceful than it has looked in a very long 
time.
You watch as a graceful dove flys up from the balcony below up into the 
blue sky. As you turn to go back into the room, you see a black bird out 
of the corner of your eye, moving swiftly upward. As you re-enter the 
room, an old man who you recognize is standing near the dead body of 
Siriadne. His face shows a mixture of serenity andcontentment. He 
speaks:
'The True springtime shall now return to Ymros because of what you have 
done today.'
'Your names shall be remembered as long as men exist to sing of you'.
He makes some mysterious motions and everything begins to swirl about 
you.
His voice speaks to you out of the dizziness 'Evil is personified in the 
form of dragons, but borne in the hearts of men...'

      ******IN THE TOMBS******

The Tomb of Murthin (the mad). Fancy inscription reads 'This tree 
represents the life that you gave us'. Graffiti reads 'Nothing without a 
heart can live. This tree is the only thing in this tomb that was ever 
truly alive'

The tomb of Cercion. Inscription reads 'For a man who loved the sea and 
died by it'. Scratchings read 'That makes us proud we drown him in it'

The Tomb of Vandiguard. Inscription reads 'May these eternal fires 
always burn in your memory'. Second scrawled inscription reads 'and may 
you burn in Hell for as long...'

The Tomb of Lothian. Plaque reads 'Your life was a maze of reality and 
illusion'. Second plaque reads 'May you be lost forever...'

BUGS/NUISANCES

Your maximum food is 255 and if you buy more you'll just get your cash 
ripped off.  Max stats are also 255.

The game never tells you when an item in your inventory helps you;  the 
disk just loads.  For instance, at the gold door, it says "a locked gold 
door" but if you have the gold key the disk loads and you pass the 
square.

After you've won a fight, you sometimes still get the description scene.  
For instance, beating the singing fighters in Edrin's Keep doesn't stop 
you from hearing them afterwards anyways.

Getting 256 hit points causes the program to break.

CHEATING

I don't know if I fully recommend cheating.  It gets rid of tedious 
combat, but if you want the "whole package" cheating will ruin that--and 
to be honest, the puzzles aren't the most terribly complex.  But here 
goes(assuming you know a little about hex and have a hex editor:)

This relies on general editing strategies.

Create five characters.  Band them together.

Say one is called BIPH.  Let's say his stats are 6, 7, 8, 10, and 13.  
Then search the file for BIPH as a string, or 0x42 0x49 0x50 0x48 
hexadecimal.  Some games have the highest byte flipped, meaning you have 
to search for 0xc2 0xc9 0xd0 0xc8(add 0x80 to all of them....)

The characters' info being 32 bytes long, you should see the name, then 
a list of bytes 06 07 08 0a 0d for Biph's stats.  Change them to 250 if 
you want.  That's what I did.  If you want to rake in the hit points, 
there will be numbers after that--there should be two equal.  Change the 
first two you find like that.

If Biph is a spell caster then the next two bytes should be equal(one is 
max, one is current) so if you change them, BAMMO!  Biph's got spell 
points.

Note:  if you train Biph, he loses these super-stats.  The bytes for 
Biph's skills are set to either 0 or 1 so you can tinker with them if 
you want.  I don't think you'll need to.

As for gold, you might want to wait until you've got over 256.  Then 
search for that number in hex.  For instance, if you have 2867 gold, 
then 2869 = 2816 + 48 + 5 = a35.  So you will want to search for the hex 
number 0a35, commonly expressed as 35 0a(the byte-pairs are FLIPPED.)

As for provisions, just cheat with gold and buy them.
