  ABOUT YOUR CHARACTERS

    Much of this is taken from the manual at theunderdogs.org.  In the 
interest of [relative] brevity I only included stuff of major interest.

rule.]

    SEA COMBAT

MOVEMENT POINTS:  Since it's easier to keep going in one direction on
a ship than to turn, the following adjustments are made:

KEY                  ACTION                  MOVEMENT POINTS
Return               Move forward            1

    MOVEMENT

Characters and monsters move in an order determined by their speed
ratings, from highest to lowest.  Each character has movements points
equal to their speed, which they can spend on the following actions:

KEY                  ACTION                  MOVEMENT POINTS
Return               Move forward            2

    SKILLS LIST[ANNOTATED]

      WEAPON SKILLS

Each of these skills represents the training required to use a weapon
of that type.  Characters without the appropriate skill for a weapon
may not use it.  Daggers require no skill.  See Appendix F for a
complete list.

AXE:  Use of the small axe and the dreaded battle axe.

KARATE:  Use of the hands as a weapon.  When a character has this
skill and "equips" (see the section on Camp) with his hands, he does
damage dependent on his Skill Trait.  A skillful warrior with karate
can do as much damage as the mightiest sword.

MACE:  Use of the mace and morningstar.

SWORD:  Use of the short sword, broadsword, or the mighty two-handed
sword.


      OTHER COMBAT SKILLS

ARMORED SKIN  This skill will give you the tough skin of a veteran
warrior, adding the protection of leather armor to whatever armor you
may be wearing.

BERSERKING:  The ability to go beserk in combat, giving the character
a 25% chance of doing critical damage instead of the normal 10%
chance.

FENCING:  Advanced swordplay that gives the character an additional
10% bonus to hit and an additional 8% chance to do critical damage.

KUNG-FU:  Advanced karate that gives the character a chance of
stunning his opponent when attacking with his hands.  The stunned foe
is motionless for one round for each critical hit.  In this state the
foe is easier to hit.  Karate is not necessary to learn kung fu, but
it is helpful.

TACTICS:  Allows the character to know who each monster is planning to
attack before it does, which is helpful in deciding what to do.
[Seems pretty darned useless.]


      RUNE MAGIC
[Note:  If you don't start the game with these, the places to learn them 
are not easy to find.

FIRE RUNES:  Six spell dealing with fire, an element of destruction.

METAL RUNES:  Seven spells dealing with metal, an element of weapons and 
binding.

WIND RUNES:  Seven spells dealing with the wind, an element of speed, 
movement, and subtle power.

ICE RUNES:  Six spells dealing with ice, an element of confinement and 
damage.

SPIRIT RUNES:  Nine spells dealing with the spirit, an element of life 
forces, mental powers, and resurrection.

[Note:  there are also the God Runes, which cast Uncurse(for the three 
glyphs, 50 points) and Imprison(for Malifon, 100 points.)

      CHANTS
[None of these seem terribly useful.]

ILLUSION:  Allows the caster to conjure an illusionary ally who will 
fight until killed or is disbelieved.

SUMMON:  Allows the caster to conjure a true summoned being who will 
follow the summoner's orders until killed.  Costs twice as much as an 
illusion.

POSSESSION:  A very powerful chant that allows the caster to take 
control of one of his foes and command him.  See "Possession".


      VISIONARY SKILLS

VIEW LAND:  allows the user to get a bird's eye view of his surrounding 
outdoors, even at night.
[I've got maps up, making this less useful.  Still, in a pinch, it's 
nice, since you can see 100 squares away vertically AND horizontally!  
Since it costs so much for a non-visionary, you might want to leave it.]

VIEW ROOM:  Allows the user to look forward into a room or passage and 
see what's there without danger.
[Not too useful--SAVE THE GAME BEFORE ENTERING :)]

VIEW MIND:  Used to detect if a merchant is lying about an item for 
sale.
[Can be handy.]

      LORE
[These are all expensive ones to pick up, unless you have an IMO 
otherwise worthless Scholar.  You can have weapons shops ID them for 
free by saving the game, entering a town, ID'ing at the marketplace, and 
then rebooting.]

WEAPON LORE:  Knowledge of various weapons and armaments.

POTION LORE:  Knowledge of vials and salves.

ITEM LORE:  Knowledge of miscellaneous magic items.

MONSTER LORE:  Knowledge of wandering monsters and their abilities.


      MISCELLANEOUS SKILLS

DETECT TRAPS:  The ability to check the passage in front of you for 
traps.

DISARM TRAPS:  Allows you to disarm traps found with Detect Traps.

HUNTING:  The ability to hunt for food while outdoors;  if the party is 
on a ship, this skill applies to fishing.

PERSUASIVENESS:  Improves the party's ability to haggle with merchants 
for a decent price.

PRIESTHOOD:  Allows the character choose a deity from the Priestly gods.  
See "Religion".

SHAMAN:  Allows the character to choose a deity from the Shaman gods.  
See "Religion".

[This is not from the manual:  you can buy a skill from a college.  The 
cost depends solely on how many intellect points you need for the skill 
and is calculated as follows:

Cost = 5x(x+5).  So it comes to something like this(note the difference 
in cost per intellect point increases by ten as you go up:)

Pts needed  |  Cost

1           |   30

APPENDIX C:  MAGIC ITEMS

WEAPONS:  May be enchanted with Invoked, Dormant, and Constant powers.
For Invoked powers, they may have a wide variety of spells such as
damage spells, storm spells, healing, light spells, death spells, and
chants. Invoked spells must be of the "usable x times per day" type;
no charges or breakable weapons.

ARMOR:  May contain Invoked or Constant powers.  The only invoked
powers found on armor are such spells as Flame Shield and Ice Shield.
Like weapons, Invoked spells must be of the "usable x times per day"
type; no charges or breakable weapons.

CROWN:  Not found in breakable form or with charges.  Crowns possess
powers dealing with death, summoning, illusions, magic power
transference, and armor spells such as sanctuary.

VIAL:  All vials are breakable (100% chance), yielding only one use.
They contain useful spells like Heal, Wings, Strength, Cure Poison, or
Transference.  Don't drink them without knowing their contents,
because vials of Weakness, Slow, Clumsiness, and Withering exist.

RING:  Can have any form of power (breakable, charges, etc.).  They
can cast just about any spell except Resurrection and Wind Walking.

WAND:  All wands work on the charge system.  They can possess spells
for increasing and decreasing traits (Strength, Slow) and conjuring.

STAFF:  Also has charges.  Staves are much more powerful than wands,
and possess death spells, damage spells, armor spells, and
occasionally healing spells.

ROD:  Rods possess freezing and unfreezing spells, damage, healing
spells, and Cure POison.  They also use charges.

GEM:  Magical gems can use charges, be usable x times per day, or be
breakable.  Different gems are used to gain strength, magical power,
light, and conjuring.

AMULET:  Amulets may have any type of power, including armor spells,
cure poison, and rarely Resurrection.

MEDALLION:  Medallions only exist in the "x times per day" form.  They
can contain damage and mass damage spells as well as Heal, Wings of
Victory, Chill, and Clumsiness.

TALISMAN:  A talisman will always work on the charge system.  They are
very powerful and often contain spells such as Flame Strike, Spirit
Wrack, Freeze, Strength, Weaken, and Possession.

FIGURINE:  Figurines may be of any form of power (charges, breakable,
etc.).  They appear in the shape of an animal or creature, and this is
the creature they conjure.  They are only used for summoning or
illusions.

SALVE:  Salves are like vials, but have more than one use.  They work
with charges. While salves can heal, be careful to identify them
first, for they may also Wither, Flame, or even slice up the victim.

[Summarized from the manual:  There are five each of shaman and priest 
gods.  They're listed below with what they do when you pray to them and 
they hear.]

      WHAT THE GODS DO[IF THEY LISTEN]

    ****SHAMAN GODS****
    Omizeh = resurrect
    Gamur = kill opponents
    Acisc = add weapons skill
    Volobews = add speed
    Theryni = add magic power

    ****PRIEST GODS****
    Balmur = wither foes
    Vemarkn = add magic power
    Maldorath = fiery death
    Illo = resurrect
    Camear = flee combat

  WHO I HANG WITH

    This is not the definitive guide to a party, although hopefully my 
detailing the advantages and disadvantages will allow you to make a more 
calculated choice.  The classes' main difference is the relative 
intelligence needed to pick up a skill.  There's a lot of variety to 
skills, and some are more useful than others(and some of those "others" 
are a LOT less useful!)  There's no purge ability as in other games, so 
you need to plan skill-gaining carefully.
    Out of all classes, the following seem like they can be eliminated:
--Barbarian:  great fighters, which usually means they give dwindling 
returns as the game goes on.
--Thief:  best at checking for traps, which aren't too prevalent and 
really don't hurt you much anyway.  And they're too hard to look for 
even if you do have the skills.
--Cleric:  wimpy version of a Monk.  Does some things a little better 
than a Monk, but not enough.
--Sorcerer:  only really good for casting illusions and summoning.
--Visionary:  not up to much.  "View" skills are pretty worthless.
--Scholar:  knows how to ID items, but that costs a lot of intellect 
anyway.  Just cough up the cash after you save a game.  The game seems a 
bit unfair against you, why not see if two wrongs make a right?  They'll 
certainly waste less time.
    So there are four classes left, and there are five slots.  I'd 
probably go with two paladins, since they seem the most versatile.  Here 
are all the recommended classes and what is so great about them:
--Ranger:  hunting is easy to get.  Don't get it right away--there's a 
college of hunting east of Elbarat.  He works best with a mace or an 
axe.
--Paladin:  should use a sword.  Note that he can elect for priesthood 
easily as well, but take another skill first.  In fact, since sword is 
easy to find, don't start off with that, either.  Consider starting with 
fencing.  A paladin may acquire hunting skills, and two hunters mean 
you'll never have to buy food, useful for dungeon expeditions.
--Monk:  start with kung fu and karate, since they are not in mainland 
colleges.  Easy instant offense with more long-term potential than the 
barbarian.
--Wizard:  get the ice runes and another type of runes(NOT fire, because 
you can pick that up two other places.  Ice runes are the toughest to 
find.)  My suggestion is metal runes.
  In general, don't pick up a skill with a college close to where you 
begin the game.  If you start with a lot of skills that are hard to 
find, the easy ones will fall into place after you've built up your bank 
from a few battles.
    Having Illo as a deity helps you not have to pay if a party member 
dies(oh, yeah.  You can always use the "save trick" to give your party 
member a 100% instead of a 20% chance of resurrection.)  Shamanism 
doesn't seem to be worth it and is really too expensive.  As for races, 
I'd make one party member a dwarf so you can see at night.  Trolls' 
regenerative powers don't make up for their other deficiencies unless 
you cheat your characters :), but otherwise humans and elves are safe 
choices even if it's been done before.

  THE BIG MAP

    The map of Demon's Winter is divided by disk into seven 64x64 
sections.  Each one overlaps any adjacent ones by a width/height of 8 
squares so that when you are on a border between sections, you can view 
the other side.  The world of Demon's Winter is flat and not round, and 
your crew won't sail beyond the boundaries.  So there are 64*7-6*8=400 
units to a side.  The world of Demon's Winter has 160000 squares, more 
than double the Ultima V outerworld--this is due to the compression 
used, which works roughly as follows:
[read a.  read b.  if (a&0x80) put a&0x7f out b times, unless b=0, then 
put it out x100 times.]
For instance, the bytes x94 x13 say that you put out 0x14 0x13 times, 
and 0x94 0x00 says put out 0x14 0x100 times.  It's a lot like Deathlord 
and although it may save a bit more space it doesn't allow for as many 
special squares(127 possible icons in DW, 255 in Deathlord.)  It's neat 
to know that the disk will load on the Apple when you change sectors, 
which allows you to keep track of where you are even when you think 
you're lost.  But as they said in Spinal Tap, enough of my yackin'.  
Let's boogie.

  LONG WALKTHROUGH(WITH SIDE TRIPS)

  You can actually skip a lot of Demon's Winter, but the story isn't as 
filled-out.  For instance, if you restart a party you know the clue from 
Uffuspgot's and can proceed from there as if you knew it.  Note:  to 
find what you can skip, search for the next occurrence of "xyzzy."
  The general technique for walking through a dungeon is as follows:  
use the "I" key to see where items are(usually in a room with a 
description,) "E" on that square, try to T/Take or M/Move the object.  
Also try to U/Use every object you find on that square.  This trial-and-
error should get you through the puzzle part of the game.

    ****UFFUSPGOT'S****

  This is a smash-and-grab expedition requiring no ingenuity whatsoever.  
It's just an open square space with a bunch of tents and campfires.  
I'll list below all the relevant locations.  Monster roll calls indicate 
a fight:

  4W, 3S:  tent with 4 kobolds
  3W, 6S:  note
  3E, 4S:  note
  7E, 2S:  4 kobolds
  11S:  4 kobolds
  13S:  Uffuspgot, 2 orcs, 2 kobolds
  12S, 3W:  woman held captive

    ****TUNNEL TO GAMUR'S TEMPLE****

  This, due north of the bridge northeast of the College of hunting, 
doesn't have much besides a guy saying the person you seek is a puppet.  
This comes into play near the end, but it may be a confusing clue for 
now.

    ****GAMUR'S TEMPLE****

  From the kobold camp, you know the password.  Actually, it's a pass-
letter.  "-x-" should be x.  Type it, and you are welcomed.  This is the 
first "real" dungeon in Demon's Winter.  There are a lot of items to 
find, and there are even puzzles with clues.
  There are two areas, beyond the secret door maze and before it.  
Before it, you find, when you go west from the stairs, a hallway.  To 
the north, west and south is a room with a bed and an IRON KEY which you 
can take.  Back to the hallway, if you go south, there is a SCROLL that 
tells you about Qoorik in the room to the south.  There's also a MAN IN 
THE GLASS CASE that you'll have to come back for.  Back in the hallway, 
follow it to a lab.  Two south of the entry is a CAGE.  Use the iron key 
to get wind of a secret passage.  Then two west of entry are a RED SERUM 
and BLUE SERUM.  You'll only need the blue stuff.  Go through the secret 
passage in the west wall.  Turning south, take a detour to pick up the 
mallet(north center of the side room) and then back in the main passage 
move the altar to reveal a secret passage.  You can go there, but you 
haven't found the information on what to do.  That's past the maze.  So 
return to the start and stop off by the MAN IN THE GLASS CASE.  Use the 
mallet on it, and then use the blue serum.  He'll tell you where to find 
Qoorik.  You can leave now or complete the dungeon entirely.
  Now go north and east to see the corridor you missed before.  The 
second door south has a room with a secret wall to the east.  There's 
also a desultory encounter with two hill giants.  The pattern through 
the maze is 4E 3N 3E 5S 3E 3S 5W S 2W 2N 2W N 6W and the full map is in 
my text map section.  Beyond that, there are some skeletons and skeleton 
mages to fight.  To the south you'll find a clue, and to the west and 
east are two rooms each with a valuable item.  You will find a dagger, a 
mace, chain mail, and a short sword to the side.  Retreat to the 
entrance and go back past the altar room.  Save first, follow the secret 
passage, and eventually you'll see a message that you hear machinery.  
Only 3E S will let you survive.  After that there is a fight with a 
hobgoblin.  Then you will fight Remondadin.  There's a back-door exit 
you'll have to take to get out.

    ****QOORIK****

  Oo, this one's fun.  South of the main continent, there's a town 
called Idlewood.  Three north and four west is the Demon City of Qoorik, 
invisible 'til you step in it.  Yeah, there's some **** going down in 
that place, too, but at least you can't smell it.

xyzzy

NOTE:  You didn't actually have to go through any of the previous 
dungeons.  The following ones are pretty necessary.


    ****ICE DRAGON'S****

  This is north of the kudzu continent, just south of the northern edge 
of the world, and 80 squares east from the west edge.  It's also known 
as the crystal cave.  To the north, you find the ice dragon, and west of 
there is a path to the College of Ice Runes.  Going back to the "lobby" 
you can go south(the west passage, as the east passage exits) and fight 
a yeti to pick up the ICICLE, the first item in the game you'll actually 
need.  Not much else to do.

    ****ICE CATHEDRAL****

  This is just a bit west of the Ice Dragon's.  Your first time around, 
find the scroll(northwest corner) and Jesric(to the east of that.)  
Beating Jesric in combat gets you the HEAVY AMULET.  While you're at it 
there's an area that can't be mapped, south of Jesric.  There's a secret 
door on the west side, and you'll find the DEMON CRYSTAL there.  Then 
just use the icicle(southwest part) to get to the ALTAR.  Use the PRAYER 
SCROLL at the altar.  You'll be given a mission.  You'll also be told to 
convert to the ancient god's religion, but that's not necessary.

    ****KALEK-ZIN'S****

  IMPORTANT:  You may want to improve your party before going on this.  
If you want to read more, see below.
  Go east a while, and you'll find an island with desert and mountains.  
The inlet will lead you to Kalek-Zin's.  Go north, and in the room 
there's a secret door in the north wall.  In the fire room there are 
secret doors in the west and east walls.  Visit Kalek-Zin's ghost for 
kicks and then go through one of the doors.  To be "worthy" you must 
visit all ten locations and they are laid out as follows(order doesn't 
matter:)

      0   1   2
      |   |   |
      |   |   |
      3   4   5
      |   |   |
      |   |   |
    +-+---+---+-+
    |           |
  6-+-S-------S-+-7
      |       |
  8---+       +---9

In each one, if you have a member of a certain class, they are given a 
task--or not.
0=scholar.  No fight, just a message with a clue--the words "use faceted 
mirror in dark chapel" are in code.
1=sorcerer.  You must fight a stalker.
2=barbarian.  You must fight a large dragon.
3=cleric.  You must fight 5 zombies, 2 ghosts.
4=thief.  There are traps before this room, but you're still worthy even 
if they're set off.
5=ranger.  You must fight a cave bear.
6=visionary.  You are told "to lead the way."  Worthless advice, but no 
fight.
7=monk.  You must fight a karate master.
8=paladin.  You must fight an evil spirit.
6=wizard.  You must fight an imp.

  After going through these, return to Kalek-Zin's(the north niche of 
the room) to get the ORB OF EVERTIME.  Back to the Ice Cathedral.

    ****[Guy Smiley voice]NEWS FLASH![/Guy Smiley voice]****

  The first time you rest after getting the Orb, Malifon will start 
talking trash.  The next time, he kinda trashes all the towns.  Be 
forewarned that there's no turning back once you get the Orb.  You can't 
repair your ship, get food, etc.

    ****RETURN TO THE ICE CATHEDRAL****

  Back at the altar(use your icicle to get in,) use the prayer scroll 
and get one of your guys the God Runes.  And now for a light-hearted 
break.  You may want to get better weapons to fight Malifon.  A good 
method is listed below.

    ****SIDE TRIP:  DWARVES' PLACE****

  On the kudzu continent(west of Ymros, south of the Ice Cathedral) 
there is an obvious path between Ynoth and some dungeon or other.  Time 
to explore this place.  There is not too much to do here(but stuff is 
done for you), although you must watch out for some traps.  The dwarves 
are in the northeast corner.
  You are charged approximately 550 gold times the enchantment for each 
"+" you add you your armor.  So to enchant something from +2 to +6, you 
would need to pay 1650+2200+2750+3300=9900 gold.  After the towns are 
destroyed, it's the only place besides colleges(and temples--an apparent 
bug!) where your gold is worth a plug nickel.

    ****ISLAND EAST OF SOUTHERN YMROS****

  Well, that title explains where to go next.  This island(not the one 
with the healing pool) boasts two dungeons.  A mountain path leads to an 
old lady's hut.  Sleep there and go to the buildings(follow the mountain 
range that goes off to the north to where it curves south) and then in 
the dungeon, go east, south, across the bridge, and when you enter the 
barrow, go west.  Ring the bell.  The runes before it say "ring bell at 
midnight" and you just did, if you made it in time(if the screen said 
"The sun is rising," try again.)  You can also take out the bellkeeper 
and his dog in separate rooms if you'd like.
  Now go to the west side of the lake and fight the titans and mountain 
giant.  Go southeast with the ship and through the gate.  Go south and 
you'll be asked your name.  Respond JESRIC.  Following the path to a 
room teleports you.  From there you go east, and at the crossroads, 
going north shows you the runes "AT COMETFALL CAST THE SPELL TO BREAK MY 
BINDING" but going south and walking around the room teleports you to an 
anteroom--across the bridge to the north and south are teleport rooms.  
Once you exit the room you are teleported to, don't go east--that's a 
teleport back.  Instead go north(or west and north, depending which you 
went to) and you'll be asked to show evidence you belong.  Use the HEAVY 
AMULET.  Go all the way north, east and then north and you'll be in a 
small room.  Go east through the secret wall, north, and the second door 
on the west leads to a winding trail and eventually Eregore.  Respond as 
follows to the questions:  "You cannot harm us..." and "He was the 
greatest..." and "If he plans."  If not, no big deal.  You just have to 
fight Eregore.  At the north is the Facet Mirror.  Take it.  Then get 
out by going to the east teleport room you avoided before--the teleport 
in the center, followed by taking the past east, leads you back to where 
you answered "Jesric."

    ****DU COTE DE CHEZ MALIFON****

  He's not quite in the southeast corner of the world.  But if you go 
northwest from there,  you'll find his island.  It's also directly south 
of the temple.  Find the glyphs on the island, walk over to them, camp 
and cast UNCURSE.  There's one in each of the three arms of the island.  
When you're done with that, make sure to bide time until your God Runes 
person's spell points are over 100(so he can cast imprison) and go 
between the two bottom arms to find the dark chapel.  Enter it, and at 
the center, use the Facet Mirror.  Then go north, answer the 
puzzle(there are runes, and the chanters say "Power, Spirit, Divinity."  
You can find the fourth set of runes's meaning from the first three.

[filler to avoid spoiler of a neat puzzle]




  After you answer "Void" go north until you see stairs.  You're 
outside, but inside the mountain.  Go west two and the two-part maze is 
not difficult.  In the meantime note the demon crystal, once glowing 
dimly, is now purple.  Just push east and you'll hit a teleport.  Push 
east again, and after a while you must go north(the demon crystal turns 
red here) and after crossing a nastily guarded bridge keep going north.  
Enter the tent in the replica of Ymros, just like you entered the 
kobolds' tent.  Then go through the replica of Malifon's temple and find 
your way to the replica of the old lady's hut, noting that the crystal 
has turned orange.  Then before you enter the dragon's cave, note that 
the crystal is white.  Cast imprison, and you'll have won the game.  But 
DON'T step in the dragon's cave.

  I think you need the Demon's Crystal to win the game, but I'm not 
sure.  It's one of the cases I didn't check.  

  VERY BRIEF WALKTHROUGH

  The *very brief* walkthrough is as follows:

  1.  Kobold Camp(not necessary)--attack Uffuspgot, win the fight.
    You get the info that "-x-" is the code word for the temple of 
Gamur.
  2.  Temple of Gamur, D4(not necessary)--find Remondadin, and kill him.
  3.  Qoorik(not necessary)--ancient demon city NW of Idlewood in C5--  
3N4W of Idlewood--kill Xeres in big fight.
  4.  Ice Dragon's Cave(B1)--kill the dragon and get the icicle.
  5.  Ice Cathedral(B1)--behind a secret door, you find the Demon 
Crystal.  A fight with Jesric is here(get the medallion.)  Use icicle to 
enter the altar room.
 6a.  Improve your characters and stock up, as the towns will all be 
destroyed after the next step.
  6.  White Knights(D1)--complete the class-specific quest and get the 
orb from Kalek-Zin
  7.  Ice Cathedral(B1)--back to the altar room.  Get the orb blessed, 
and one character learns God Runes too.
  8.  Old lady's hut(F4)--accept her offer to sleep there.
  9.  Buildings(F4)--move quickly to accomplish your mission before 
daybreak.  To the east and south of the entrance is an island with the 
Bellkeeper's Tower on it.  Go forward to ring the bell, then get out.  
Back around to the left, take the boat across to the temple.  Use the 
medallion and identify yourself as "JESRIC."  To avoid fighting Eregore, 
you must choose the dialog "You cannot harm us..." and "He was the 
greatest..." and "If he plans."
 10.  Malifon's (E5, F5, F6)--cast UNCURSE on each glyph.  You'll need 
50 spell points each, or a total of 150.  Enter the dungeon below in E6.  
It comes back up inside the mountains.
 11.  Answer "void" at the center of the temple.  Go north and through 
the maze.  When you get to the place that looks like the Ice Dragon's 
cavern, camp and cast Imprison.  You'll have won the game.

  TEXT MAPS

The text maps may not be *100* percent accurate(see the tombstones, for 
instance) and they are collated a bit, but they seemed to be worthy 
enough to include here.

Key:
! = special event
X = walls
S = secret door
F = fire(can't pass through)
' = forest terrain
. = normal terrain
H = bridge
* = tent
v = dwelling/new location
^ = stairs(up/down)

You enter at the southwest.  From there you go to the center of that 
location, answer the riddle, jump to the other, use the mirror.  Then 
there's a long corridor to the north(there's a teleport at the top that 
goes to the bottom of this map.)  The left-hand dungeon after you climb 
out stars in the lower right.  There's a teleporter in the lower right 
corner.

  TAVERN TALK

The tavern talk adds nicely to the story, so I thought I'd add it here.

--SEASIDE:
...Jesric embarked yesterday on a quest for some powerful crystal. He's 
some kind of evil priest ...works for some guy named Eregore

--ASAHT:
...We would not have all these problems if the White Knights were still 
around. They were great warriors, and especially adept at fighting 
demons...

--JANTHRIN:
Whatever you do, son, don't sail too far southeast. The volcano doesn't 
like visitors. It has three crimson Glyphs that cause anyone who walks 
even near it to rot away into a lifeless husk

--IDLEWOOD:
Deep within the ancient demon city of Qoorik lies a place called the 
Amber Vault where one may seek guidance in the flaming runes...

--MOJURED:
...With the Ancients gone and Malifon imprisoned, the Earth awoke from 
its creation and life appeared. As Man began to pray, new gods began to 
appear, each aiding mankind with the limited powers endowed by his 
worship

--AKISTU:
Do not sail near the edge of the world, Matey, or you will surely fall 
off into oblivion!

--CHANDRIS, PALADINE:
The adventurers seem rather glum and don't have much to say

--DRAGONTOOTH:
I heard that a few months back some guy found the Shard of Spring. 
Hasn't been seen since it disappeared 200 years ago. If anything happens 
to that Shard we will all be destroyed by the Winter that follows

--YNOTH:
...and a valiant band of adventurers stormed the Tower of Ralith and 
killed the evil dragon Siriadne, returning the Shard of Spring to Ymros

--LAND'S EDGE:
...and the wizard set a huge tidal wave upon the attacking fleet sending 
it down in the depths of the ocean. Late on foggy nights at sea one 
should beware the ghosts of the pirate fleet...

--[forgot]:
...and Malifon made the Earth his home. Soon the Ancients became angry 
at Malifon and in a great battle, banished him inside a volcano to live 
until the end of time...

--ELBARAT:
An old woman is talking about how her house was burnt to the ground the 
last time the Kobolds attacked. The Kobolds have a camp to the south and 
are led by Uffuspgot

As a bonus(I didn't know where to put it) here is a list of the types of 
merchants you may find in Ymros, from poorest to richest:
ragged looking
poor looking
travelling
adventuring
well dressed
upper class
wealthy


  WINNING ENDGAME STUFF

    If you win the game and do not elect immortality, each of your 
characters succeeds in different ways.  They are listed below.

1.  [RANGER] went back to the town of Woodhaven and was instrumental in 
its reconstruction. After rebuilding the city, he settled down there and 
lived to a ripe old age
2.  [PALADIN] went on to unite the remaining peoples of Ymros and 
quickly became its first King. He ruled Ymros wisely until the end of 
his days.
3.  [BARBARIAN] walked off alone to fight the monsters that still 
wandered aimlessly after Malifon was imprisoned. His bravery became well 
known throughout Ymros and he still lives on in legends.
4.  [MONK] wandered for a while and then dissapeared into the mountains, 
never to be seen again. Many a tale says he will return to Ymros if ever 
needed again.
5.  [CLERIC] became the first in two millenium to take the title of High 
Priest of the Ancient One. With his accumulated wealth, he built an 
enormous temple to the Ancients and spread word of the new god.
6.  [THIEF] heard in the tavern of untold wealth in lands to the North 
and went in search of the fortune. He gathered a party and explored many 
dungeons, eventually retiring in luxury.
7.  [WIZARD] went on a great quest for the Lifestone in order to build a 
new Shard of Spring. While he did not live to see its completion, the 
new Shard was named in memory of him and still protects Ymros.
8.  [SORCERER] went to the hills to build a school of magic. It soon 
became famous and many of his pupils later became legends in their own 
right.
9.  [VISIONARY] served as advisor to the new King of Ymros. Due to his 
excellent advice and forsight, the land of Ymros remained in peace as 
long as he lived.
10.  [SCHOLAR] devoted his life to studying the Battle of the Gods. His 
life's work was compiled into a tome of a thousand pages and stood as an 
example for all scholars to follow.

    If you have two characters of the same class, it will say:
[CHARACTER 2] followed in the footsteps of [CHARACTER 1].

  CHEATING

    I felt this game was too tough as it was.  Maybe I was overawed by 
it, but it is rather complex, so if you just want to concentrate on the 
puzzles and storyline, this section may be for you.

    This is not so bad, actually.  I don't have the actual offsets for 
each system but here's general information on how to find them.  See my 
Shard of Spring FAQ for more details.  Basically, you want to search for 
your characters' names, possibly shifted by 0x80.  For instance, TIM is 
0x54 0x49 0x4d (Tim would be 0x54 0x69 0x6d) and so you would search for 
that or for 0xd4 0xc9 0xcd--0x80+everything.  When you get there you 
might want to look for your stats.  It's a good idea to write down Tim's 
stats, and if they are 6, 8, 11, 8, and 7 you would want to search for 
that hex sequence in the area where you find Tim(you might want to name 
your character something more exotic since the word Tim or a part of it 
might be found elsewhere.)  Once you find it search for 6, 8, 11, 8, and 
7 or something like them and edit those bytes.  The four bytes just 
after comprise current/max hit points and spell points.

  VERSIONS/CREDITS

Version 2.0.0 written 12/31/2000 and submitted then too.  The Demon's 
Winter abated a couple of days ago, coincident with my *solving* the 
game, strangely :).
Version 1.0.0 written 12/13/2000 with weather conditions outside that 
sure do seem like Demon's Winter :).  Items, overland maps, monsters and 
cheating techniques are included in this version.  Submitted to GameFAQs 
on 12/21/2000.

Thanks to www.theunderdogs.org for preserving the manual.
ftp.apple.asimov.net preserved the original Apple images(cracked, 
actually, so you bypass copy protection,) and they may have the manual 
too.
www.kahei.com's freeware hex editor allowed me to improve my characters 
to 250 attributes so I could crack this thing.

There is a strong anonymous walkthrough found at the following locations 
that I visit frequently:
--vgstrategies.about.com
--gamexperts.com

It has helped me immensely in figuring out what parts of the map go 
where.
