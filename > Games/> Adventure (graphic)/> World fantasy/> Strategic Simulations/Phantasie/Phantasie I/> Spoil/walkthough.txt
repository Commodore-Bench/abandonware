  INTRODUCTION AND QUIRKS

    I actually would prefer the Apple version to the PC counterpart if 
it did not turn out all buggy.  The Commodore version which you can find 
on Arnold works better, and I've been able to solve the game with that.

  APPLE VS. COMMODORE

    Shay Addams's QUEST FOR CLUES tipped me off that the Phantasie map 
is rotated 90 degrees on the Commodore from the original Apple.  It's 
the same on the PC as on the Commodore.  The monster attributes and 
items all seem the same, however.

  ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT AND HOW IT WAS WRITTEN

    This document will not attempt to explain basic rules.  You can find 
manuals at project64.c64.org, www.theunderdogs.org, and likely many 
other places I don't know about.  I am largely concerned with details, 
i.e. if you do X, Y happens, or the best/most convenient way to solve 
puzzle Z is to do W.
    Sadly there was no PC version of Phantasie, so I had to make do with 
the Apple for data extraction.  I mentioned the, err, quirk above and 
every effort has been made to ensure that traces of it are ironed out in 
this FAQ.
    The text map is actually for the Apple, where it is easier and more 
logical to extract sectors than the Commodore.  Yes, the rotations made 
things a bit tough, but with appropriate fudging of variables(they'd 
send my HS computer-science teacher into a tizzy.  Oh well!) I changed 
the Apple maps to look like Commodore ones.  The dungeon maps are for 
the Apple but when I ran through the game they equated over 99.99% with 
the Commodore.
    This document tries to explore the details of the game, so it may be 
light on overall improving your characters.  A brief run-through showed 
that the Phantasie series is really rather moderate, and it is 
relatively easy to improve without getting squashed.

  MONSTER MANIFEST

    In future versions of Phantasie, the attributes are coded as bytes, 
but in this one they are still encoded as text.  Therefore there is the 
possibility for attributes above 65535.  I've got a partial list of 
monster attributes below.

  SCROLLS

    As you go through the game, you will encounter several scrolls that 
will give you hints as to what to do in the game.  I've listed them in 
their entirety but of course they can be major spoilers.

  WALKTHROUGH

    GETTING BETTER

  The introductory strategy where you create characters, pool gold, and 
destroy them works pretty well.  Of course with pooling, etc. they will 
have some gold left over, but you can always withdraw their money from 
the bank and split it up again.  You'll lose some gold in rounding down, 
but you won't need much to start.
  If you can visit the pools quickly, do so.  Each one doubles a random 
statistic for each party member, then subtracts ten.  At first you will 
probably spend a lot of time shuttling between the first dungeon and 
Pelnor or, alternatively, Pineville and the Cathedral(the first pool is 
on the way there.)  Give your wizard the lion's share of the experience 
points so that he can get the transport spell.  This will enable you to 
zap around the country to important locations quickly.  Remember to 
check with the mystic for your score.  It seems to be based on levels 
attained as well as runes and rings found.
  Running through dungeons quickly, resetting them, and trying over is a 
good way to improve as well.  It takes less internal game time, and you 
will figure out where the forced and tough combats are.  In addition 
special items can be re-duplicated as you pass through again.
  My blanket starting party for Phantasie is:  2 dwarf fighters, 2 elf 
priests, and 2 elf wizards.  Obviously in Phantasie I you will need a 
character of a different race, but that is off in the future and only 
temporary anyway.  Remember clerics can develop offensive spells too, so 
if they get low on learning, wait a bit until they can learn fireflash 
3/4.  The spell attacking every monster is not always useful as often it 
does much less damage than the concentrated one.
  Inns are usually a waste of gold, but later when you get rich and are 
trying to get through a dungeon they're easier to walk back to than 
towns.  However, you won't be able to identify and/or sell your items to 
improve your party.

    GETTING AROUND

  Age probably should not be a serious problem in Phantasie, but it is a 
nagging one, especially for people like me who get the creeps thinking 
about mortality in general.  I've included some tips on how to move 
around the continent of Gelnor quickly so you spend minimal time on a 
quest.  It seems that time passes quickly in dungeons but each unit of 
movement costs one day.  Given this, it's pretty clear that you can save 
a lot of time with the Town Transport spell.  I've included a list of 
important locations and the nearest towns with their numbers below to 
help you if you wish to get somewhere quickly.

    GETTING THROUGH

    Here come the spoilers.  They completely ignore the information you 
need to figure all this out, so be warned this solution cuts stuff out.  
The first dungeon you face will be relatively simple.  Off to the west 
you have a pair of rooms with a button and a lever.  Pull the lever in 
the west room, and that will unlock the unmovable door leading to the 
room above.  Talk to the old man, and he will give you the earth rune.  
To the south there will be some information which will help you along in 
the game.
    In general you will be given multiple-choice puzzles which, if you 
answer incorrectly, can be redone if you reset the dungeon.  Better yet, 
if you have save states on the emulator, you can check what each option 
does(incidentally, this method helps when writing FAQs.)  It cuts down 
on the challenge of the game, but it also adds a different, powerful 
magic to it.  I guess.
    The second dungeon may actually need to be saved for later.  The 
transporters behind the secret doors(experiment a lot by running into 
walls) are annoying to deal with, but one will push you to the bottom 
center.  Just to the west is the air rune room.  If you can burn the box 
you will get it, but if you're not strong enough, go find the pools and 
the other runes.  To leave go to the end of the hallway.
    The third rune is found in the Lizard Men's cave.  It's right near 
the entrance(south, east, south,) but you'll need to defeat two tough 
fire elementals, each in a separate battle, to reach the person holding 
it.
    The fourth rune is the water rune.  It's in Lord Wood's castle and 
is rather tricky to pick up.  You need to have visited the other three 
pools aboveground first.  For one you'll have needed to cast town 
transport to Phantasia(8) and then stepped on the square which looked 
different from the rest of the sea.  If you can, look in the Phantasia 
armory while you're there.  You should notice a very interesting item.
    In the meantime we've skipped over Woodville, which has some useful 
and interesting clues.  It's the weirdest of the dungeons, with a lot of 
town-like activity going on, and you can even fight a deity if you are 
silly or strong enough to.
    Now that you've got the runes you can start hunting for the 
dungeons.  JR Trolkin's place is first.  You'll get thrown in a cell, 
but be on the lookout for secret doors(at some places there are several 
in a row) and if you can get to JR's room in the bottom, there's a nice 
treasure hoard behind.  Rings 1-3 are there.
    Now go visit the Bleebs.  These guys throw tricky little logic 
puzzles at you.  Remember that the blue pools damage you, the red ones 
activate green pools, and the green ones teleport you.  Write down all 
the advice you get and examine it for contradictions.  You can eliminate 
an assumption by saying "If bleebs of color X tell the truth, then Y, 
then Z which is impossible."  At the end you get multiple choice 
questions.  If you don't pass them, you're kicked to a one-way exit, but 
you can just go back and try again having saved the dungeon.  But you'll 
feel better if you figure the puzzle out.  Three rings here.
    The Dosnebian Clerics--oh those tricky Dosnebians--are next.  Here 
you'll need a minotaur in your party.  Don't worry if he gets killed.  
Even having a dead minotaur will get you in the front door.  The object 
here is to find Lord Wood.  There's a prison cell with three prisoners 
at the bottom of the screen, and that's where you'll find him.  You'll 
get two rings from him, which makes eight from the dungeons, plus the 
one you bought in Phantasia.
    Now you have to go to the castle of the Gods.  This is actually the 
easiest dungeon in the game.  No secret doors, nothing.  There are six 
small rooms adjacent to a circular hallway.  In five of them, you walk 
to the back and are told you passed the test, or you should be if you've 
gotten all nine rings and four runes.  In the sixth, there are two 
undead monsters you need to fight.  Get by them and you will have passed 
the test of battle.  After passing all tests you'll see a passage open 
to the south.  Zeus is there;  pray to him, and he will reward your 
party.  You will now be able to enter the final dungeon without being 
overcome by fear.
    The final dungeon has some combats and some multiple choice, but it 
is not so bad.  You basically want to destroy Nikademus's wealth when 
you come across it, and you'll need to fight through some black knights.  
When asked, run after Nikademus.  You'll need to defeat the Black Lord, 
his henchman, at the end of it all to win.  Filmon congratulates you 
afterwards.

    OVERWORLD MAP WITH SECTORS


    The world map in Phantasie is divided into several sectors.  Each 
sector is 26x20, and you can usually see it all at once, unless there 
are areas you haven't explored.  There is no scrolling.  The text maps 
below will attempt to show what each square does.  On the commodore many 
important places have widths of two icons, like your party, but nothing 
happens until you step smack in the center.  The maps below point out 
where "smack in the center" is.
    In general, as you progress in a counterclockwise spiral, you 
approach more important sectors.  Of course you can cut across the water 
when your players get to be good swimmers as well.

  Well, there's not a whole lot to do here except go south from Olympia.  
It seems that you always run into an encounter after moving a couple of 
squares, with some trolls, goblins and orcs.  If you want, you can flee, 
but if you can't win that sort of fight you probably can't pass the 
dungeon to the south.
  You need a special spell to get here and to leave.

  ! = Charon's boat to cross the river Styx

  Not much to do here.  You can't swim across the river Styx so you have 
to grope your way around for a passage.  It's actually one east of 
Olympia and directly south.  The dungeon is east-south-east.  Given that 
you can't see the terrain until you walk near it, finding the dungeon is 
not quite as trivial as it seems.

  Woodville, purportedly a town in the lore but actually a dungeon by 
the game's definition, rests on the west bank.  There is also an inn 
which doubles as a town;  however, the only way to get here is to use 
town transportation.  The town name is Appleton, and it is town number 
five.
  The dungeon has some useful stuff but you can't accomplish its main 
purpose until you have explored other parts over land.
  There may be a nasty combat in the hills but the monsters are still 
manageable.  Woodville, however, is much tougher.

t = town of Phantasia(#8)

    You've probably noticed that a certain part of this sector is 
barricaded off.  Phantasia like Appleton in (0,3) can only be found by 
use of a special spell.  You'll want to stop in at the pool before 
leaving to the south.  The pool is pretty well disguised with all the 
water around it, but it helps to know that it's against the edge of the 
north boundary.  The programmers cheat to let you out;  once you leave 
to the south you are standing on a barricade, making the de facto one-
way door work.

    That dungeon on the west coast is J. R. Trolkin's.  It's not an easy 
one to go through.  The inn is called "The Silver Star."  This is also 
where you get kicked after exploring the restricted area in (0,2).

  The town here, Dragonor(9) is nice and all, and being by the sea it's 
probably more beautiful than Trollport, a better place to walk to the 
second pool from.  I mean, I'm sure the residents are fine people.  It's 
just not a particularly useful place for determined adventurers to be, 
that's all.  The inn is called "The Lonely Inn."

  This is a useful sector.  The town, Halflingor/Hobbiton(depending on 
the version you have.  It's Halflingor on the C64/PC, which is 
appropriate as there is no Hobbit character) is good to transport to.  
It's very close to the dungeon, Lord Wood's Castle.  The inn is called 
"The Greenleaf Inn."

Probably the second sector you'll visit in the game and a good one.  The 
town, Pineville, is a good place to stop off while you visit the pool 
and the cathedral, which is the dungeon.  "The Conley Inn" rests to the 
west.

  Lots of desert here, and there is an anonymous inn on an island(no 
name is given on the PC or in the data, either.)  This sector can be 
safely ignored.  Even if used as a shortcut it is probably less time-
efficient than a transport spell.

  Northford(10) is the town here.  The inn is "The Stone Plow Inn."  
Monsters are significantly tougher here, and at this point you are 
entering the large peninsula where all monsters are significantly 
tougher, curving around Gelnor's northern inlet.
  By the way, Northford isn't very north, is it?  That's what happens 
when you rotate the map without changing names.  Ah well, they caught 
Hobbiton.

# = temple where you are resurrected/return as undead
I = "The Red Pony"

  The town is of course Pelnor(1).  The dungeon is the first one, the 
generic underground cavern that seems to start so many games out.  The 
temple is a cool place to visit although there are a lot of undead in 
the area.  If you have dispell that is not a bad thing.

  The final dungeon is here--once your party's good enough they can just 
pop on over from Pelnor.  Taking the possible water damage is safer than 
walking, not to mention less time-consuming.  There seem to be many 
Black Knights in the area, and the other monsters are nasty as well.

This sector is not totally pointless, as the town here, Starville(11), 
is somewhat close to a couple of dungeons.  However it is not one of the 
more happening places on the map, so I will let it pass with little 
comment.

  The Inn is called "The Golden Unicorn."

  DUNGEONS

    GENERAL LEGEND

  x = exit
  ~ = secret passage
  | = door(need lock-pick skill)
  - = door(need lock-pick skill)
  ! = encounter
  : = trap
  ; = you hear monsters, go back? [door or open space, but probably 
door]
  $ = treasure.  If there is any specifically valuable treasure not in 
the descriptions I will try to note it.
  ^ = stairs up/down.  Not really a special location in terms of solving 
the game.

    The more detailed descriptions of the room may be described 
qualitatively.  In general we assume a corridor is one unit wide in 
these descriptions, and a room is anything that isn't, although most of 
the time it will be rectangular in shape.  Rooms will have a description 
in some corner;  on that square, nothing special happens.

    In general the text, extracted from the Apple version, will be in 
ALL CAPS.  My comments, including various sic's, will not be shouted 
quite so loudly.

OVERVIEW:  This first dungeon is not a bad introduction.  It contains 
secret doors, traps, and doors to pick.  There are also some treasures 
and the originations of part of the story line.  The general run-around-
and-touch-everything-to-solve paradigm is in evidence here, although all 
you strictly need to do is to pick up the Earth Rune in the locked room, 
so if you want to walk through quickly, you can do so.  Later on you may 
see some information in Kilmor's room if you don't want to cheat and 
look in this FAQ.  It leads to an information trail.

To get through quickly, go south, west, and south.  The room to the west 
has a button you should push.  Now retreat but go north before you reach 
the door.  To the left you'll find the earth rune.  Now you can return 
south through the large hall and visit Kilmor's after shutting off the 
valve at the end of the bottom hallway--if washed downstream just look 
for a secret door to the south.  You'll get items and the words "NIFLE 
SCRO."

  Specialized ledger:

b : A LIBRARY FILLED WITH SCROLLS, with the treasure reading THERE ARE

OVERVIEW:  This dungeon has a few teleports and starts using secret 
doors more heavily.  It's not too hard to keep track of what teleport 
goes where, and you also have the introduction of in-dungeon items(keys 
to open certain doors.)  You may even have to reset this dungeon, and 
you may want to to pick up the treasures again.  The main point is to 
get the Earth Rune, but it's not quite clear to me how to.  Once you 
know how to get it it is easy to check if your party is good enough to 
get in and out.

  An Elegant Marble Hallway is where you begin.  It's also seen behind 
the secret doors by the transporters and leading to the stone room 
preceding the High Priest's room.  The big room on top is the small 
elegant temple of marble with "priest's room with little of value" off 
to the sides.  Other passages are "hallway carved from stone."
  On the right side is an empty stone room past the secret door, with 
the teleportation room to the lower left and a small stone cell 
everywhere else.
  In the northwest a coffin room is below the transport room, with a 
small crypt at the bottom.
  In the south you have a strange misty room, the maid's bedroom(with 
three scrolls,) janitor's room, storage room with little of value, small 
neat kitchen, and finally the bathroom.
  In the far south is the natural cavern(after you let the old man 
unlock it.)

  To get through quickly, go to the directly-south teleporter.  The 
first door to the left has the earth rune--check if you're ready for it.  
The next door to the left has a secret passage where you should wait and 
watch the man.  There's a key behind that.  Get the key and then circle 
around to the right--a gnome is there and tell him "nifle scro" as you 
found in the first dungeon.  Hit the teleporter back and go to 
teleporter C.  You can unlock the door and go to the right to avoid the 
priests and visit the high priest.

OVERVIEW:  The main item in here is shockingly easy to get and to leave 
if your party is strong enough.  The item is the fire rune, and you may 
want to have learned fireflash 4 before going in.  Once you've learned 
it, this is the sort of combat where you should use it mercilessly.  The 
information trail continues here, and there is some nice treasure behind 
a secret door or two.

In southwest there is a twisty maze of rock and rubble below (2).  Below 
(Y) combat and the secret door is a passage carved from stone with a 
fighting arena you can look into, followed by small bedrooms with old 
cots, a training area with a glass case containing mostly wooden items, 
and a sloppy, dirty kitchen.  Then the northeast part, not including the 
traps, is a passage carved from stone.  In the southeast you have a 
storage room with tasty food accessible by secret door and a small 
torture chamber where you can get some info.  There's a meeting room 
with a large table far to the south.  In the northeast there is also an 
underwater passage leading to a warrior's skeleton.

To get through this quickly, go south to a wall, east, north, east and 
south.  Nail the fire elementals and get the rune.  Towards the 
southeast you can find a torture chamber where you should rescue the 
man, who will give you information on what to do in Woodville.

Traps:  rocks and gravel fall from the ceiling, floor caves.
! : fire elemental combat
0 : IN THE PASSAGE TO THE SOUTH YOU SEE A HUGE FIERY MASS AND A DEEP, 
EERIE VOICE WHISPERS, "GO AWAY WEAK ONES."
Y : encounter with lizard men(multiple groups)
Z : encounter with death fly/bantir
a : encounter with squishy gunk
1 : keeper of the fire rune.  AN OLD MAN WITH AN ORANGE ROBE IS SITTING 
HERE. HE SAYS, "YOU ARE NOW WORTHY TO BEAR THE FIRE RUNE." HE STARTS 
CHANTING AND WAVING HIS ARMS AND CASTS A SPELL. 
2 : A SMALL CREVICE, WHICH YOU COULD FIT THROUGH, LEADS SOUTH.
3 : THE CEILING CAVES IN. YOU ARE TRAPPED. [pushed south, one-way 
passage]
4 : THROUGH A CRACK YOU CAN SEE DOWN INTO A FIGHTING ARENA.
5 : AS YOU ENTER THIS ROOM AN ALARM SOUNDS AND LAVA BEGINS POURING IN. A 
DISTINGUISHED MAN AND A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN ARE CHAINED TO THE WALLS BUT 
YOU CAN NOT SAVE BOTH. 1-RESCUE THE MAN 2-RESCUE THE MAIDEN 3-LEAVE
  [1:]  THE MAN SAYS, "THANK YOU, I AM THE UNCLE OF LORD WOOD, REMEMBER 
THIS: 'STRATICON UBLE AND 48'" THEN HE COLLAPSES AND DIES.
  [2:]  THE MAIDEN SAYS, "THANK YOU, I AM CHARISTA, AS A REWARD I GIVE 
YOU THIS." SHE HANDS YOU AN ITEM WRAPPED IN CLOTH. [you get treasure]
  [if you try to go back:] THE ROOM IS FULL OF LAVA.
6 : THROUGH A CRACK IN THE WALL YOU CAN SEE THE SKELETON OF A WARRIOR.
7 : AS YOU APPROACH THE POOL THE PARTY MEMBERS COLLASPE. YOU AWAKEN IN A 
STRANGE ROOM.
8 : A STRANGE POOL LIES TO THE WEST AND THE PARTY MEMBERS FEEL VERY 
FAINT.
9 : THE PARTY CHOKES AON THE COLD, SLIMY WATER. [everyone takes minimal 
damage even with swimming skills]
@ : THE PASSAGE TO THE WEST GOES UNDER WATER

Unused: THE BODY OF AN ELFIN FIGHTER LIES HERE.

OVERVIEW:  Ah, Woodville.  Once a great place, now it merely boasts many 
ways to get thrown in jail or be attacked by deities.  There are even 
seedy alleys.  Even the beautiful fountain is infested with monsters.  
But there are a lot of scrolls here if you look around.  This is one of 
the more lively and detailed dungeons in the game.  The rough alley in 
back of the tavern is a great place to test your abilities.  The 
fountain actually has two entrances.  An information trail started in 
the original dungeon ends here with a mission to rescue Lord Wood.  This 
is probably the first dungeon you'll stumble on that doesn't have a 
rune.  In fact, the game can be solved without ever visiting it, but you 
have important scrolls you need to read along the way.

  In the southwest are two private homes with the inn.  It has rooms 1, 
2 and 3--Kilmor's in room 1 but 3 throws you in jail.  In the southeast 
is a jewelry store below a tavern--know what to steal and you'e ok.  If 
not you get thrown in the jail to the east.  To the west there is the 
Gelnor temple and above it Filmon's Pet Shoppe.  In the northeast there 
is a scroll shop with a storage room you can see and a secret one to 
discover.
  The Woodville Records Office is south of the fountain in the town 
square.

  There are three different codes for the buttons.  They are 79, 45 and 
48.  The third lets you talk to the priest, the other two open up secret 
doors in the fountains.  No critical items to find here but some good 
scrolls.

TEMPLE AND PUSH 75."

attacks you.]
  [there are three right answers;  the first one, that Kilmor gives you, 
unlocks the upper fountain.  The second, found in the town records, 
opens a secret wall to the right fountain.  The third is found if you 
rescue the old man, when he also tells you what to say to the priest.]
L : AN OLD PRIEST STANDING HERE SAYS, "GOOD WORK MY FRIENDS, WHAT DID 
LORD WOOD'S UNCLE SAY?" 1-"WE DIDN'T RESCUE HIM" 2-"STRATICON UBLE" 3-
"TRASTICON BLUE"
  [2:] HE SAYS, "THIS INFORMATION WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE, NOW YOU MUST 
GO INTO UNKNOWN LANDS TO FIGHT THE BLACK KNIGHTS, THIS SCROLL WILL GUIDE 
YOU TO LORD WOOD WHO WILL HELP YOU. BE CAREFUL OF J. R. TROLKIN."
  [1:] (well go and rescue him you idiots)
M : teleport to N.  A secret door appears one square to the west of N.

OVERVIEW:  This is pretty simply laid out.  You have a cute little maze 
on the left with an important clue behind it.  Of course it's convenient 
that JR Trolkin has taken over the castle;  those encounters you run 
into make more sense that way.  The final rune is here.

Traps:  Boiling oil, pit with spikes.

    On the left side of the elegant marble hallway you have Lord Wood's 
Room above two master bedrooms.  In back there's a large dark closet 
leading to a clue and some scrolls.
  On the right side is a messy library with scrolls everywhere, a 
storage room, the magic pool keeper's room,  and barracks with double 
doors.
  On the south side is a room filled with smelly animals and a dark 
closet(lots of 'em here.)
  Below the main entrance is a great hall and an ordinary kitchen, with 
a secret door to 
    There's a secret door through a simple stone hallway down to an 
empty cell.

    At the south is a detention area with four small cells;  one has a 
special lock.  East of it you have a garbage pit with some fights.  West 
of it is a bit of a maze where you need to find the path to a storage 
room with an important clue.

  If you want to walk through quickly, the water rune is on the right-
hand side.  If you wish to rescue the old man, go south from the 
entrance and hit a secret door to the west.  At the bottom you'll find 
the key as treasure.  You can also take a chance on the maze in the 
corner, but there is only information with some gold there.

DEFEAT NIKADEMUS."
  "YOU SHOULD GO TO THE CASTLE OF J. R. TROLKIN TO GET THREE OTHER 
RINGS. TO AIDYOU I GIVE YOU THESE." HE SAYS HANDING YOU FOUR SCROLLS. 
"REMEMBER," HE WARNS, "THE CASTLE IS WELL GUARDED."

OVERVIEW:  JR Trolkin's castle, once you are thrown in and trapped, is 
more winding than it looks.  There will be a lot of doors you can't open 
and several you'll need to open remotely.  Your main purpose is to get 
to his treasure room where you can find three rings.  Remember to look 
for secret doors constantly.  The JR Trolkin combat shouldn't be too bad 
and overall this dungeon is pretty moderate and a good source for 
treasure too.  Just don't get too annoyed with the doors whose locks you 
can't pick.

You start outside a large stone castle.  There's nothing you can do to 
avoid getting gassed and dumped in the jail cell.  Secret doors are the 
way to go here.  A bunch of dirty stone hallways with secret doors may 
lead you to some intriguing places.  Generally if you feel trapped start 
walking into walls and eventually you'll miss.  Sorta like flying in the 
_Hitch-Hiker's Guide_.  Past the bloody fighting arena south of the 
cells you have a monster storage area with dirty smelly barracks in each 
direction.  You can also see the arena viewing areas if you go off to 
the side, but off to the south is J. R. Trolkin's room, with a trphy 
room with human and elven heads for the un-squeamish to visit.  Beyond 
the trophy room is a weapons room--that shouldn't make you 
uncomfortable, but the torture room beyond it may.  There's also a 
secret passage below leading to an encounter in a damp cavern.

  Below Trolkin's there is some treasure you can't access until you've 
been to the secret control room to the left.  There's a large key in the 
storage room to the northwest if you leave your cell and pass the 
guardroom, which has a storage room with trapped barrels to the south.

To get through the dungeon quickly, after you're thrown in the cell, 
find the secret door to the south, then push west as you go south.  In 
the secret control room, flip all three levers.  Go east to fight JR, 
south to get the rings, then push up.  You'll need to go through the 
arena, right, up and back left to the main gate.

OVERVIEW:  This is one of the most interesting dungeons in the entire 
series.  The logic puzzle is really quite nice although I feel it may 
have small flaws.  There's relatively little danger here once you learn 
which pool does what.  There are green, blue and red bleebs, and I've 
put a solution with full reasoning at the end of this.  If you miss a 
puzzle you are kicked to the square room not connected with the rest of 
the place;  however, you can reset and walk in again and take another 
multiple choice.  You won't feel as accomplished, and if you do so, I 
encourage you to go through the reasoning that leads to the correct 
answer.  Or what should be the correct answer.  Or consider why this 
puzzle is a bit iffy, so if you missed the answer in the first place, it 
won't bug you any more.

  All in all, Bleebs are cool, and since we're never given pictures of 
them, they feel that much more mysterious.

Red smoke and green smoke are the traps, even when you jump into pools.

The rooms are tricky to annotate here because they are so small.  
Therefore I needed to settle on a new convention instead of a paragraph-
style description.  I decided to annotate hallways directly in the map.  
A capital letter below denotes the start of a certain colored hallway.  
If there's a huge intersection the hallway will be fully labeled.  In 
addition the rooms have a marking in the upper left corner, or as close 
as I could get.  This corresponds with the key below.  Lots of 
red/green/blue/plain changes.

If nothing else works, jump in all the green and red pools and 
eventually you will wind up at the room in the lower left.  Enter 
through the left door and face the king bleeb.  See below for the 
solution to the puzzles which I don't want to spoil here.  However the 
right pool order is t, 6, w, y, u, 7 and z.

B : start BRIGHT RED HALLWAY
C : start BRIGHT BLUE HALLWAY
D : start BRIGHT GREEN HALLWAY
g : RED ROOM
h : BLUE ROOM
i : GREEN ROOM
j : LARGE ROOM WITH MANY DOORS
k : RED, GREEN AND BLUE THRONE ROOM
l : PLAIN STONE ROOM
" : blue pool(damage)

V : encounter with bantir/demons
W : encounter with Vampire
Y : encounter with Ghosts/ghouls
Z : encounter with sting beetles/blue oozes
a : encounter with giant ant/python
b : encounter with fire elemental
c : encounter with orange dragons
d : encounter with were wolf/were bear
e : encounter with master illusionist
f : encounter with high rangers

H : A RED BLEEB SAYS, "GREEN BLEEBS ALWAYS LIE."
I : A BLUE BLEEB SAYS, "GREEN BLEEBS TELL LIES AND TRUTHS."
J : A BLUE BLEEB SAYS, "ALWAYS LISTEN TO RED BLEEBS BUT DON'T TRUST 
THEM."
K : A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "RED BLEEBS SOMETIMES LIE."
L : A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "BLUE BLEEBS TELL LIES AND TRUTHS."
M : A BLUE BLEEB SAYS, "BLUE POOLS ARE HARMFUL."
N : A RED BLEEB SAYS, "RED POOLS SOMETIMES TELEPLORT."
O : A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "GREEN POOLS TELEPORT."

S : IN THE ROOM AHEAD YOU CAN HEAR, BUT NOT SEE, TWO BLEEBS OF DIFFERENT 
COLORS.
T : THE FIRST BLEEB SAYS, "PUSH THE BUTTON WITH MY COLOR, WHICH IS RED."
U : THE SECOND BLEEB SAYS, "IF I WERE RED I WOULD TELL YOU TO PUSH THE 
BLUE BUTTON."


0 : teleport to exit room.

! : A RED DOOR.
@ : A BLUE DOOR.
# : A GREEN DOOR.
% : A RED BLEEB SAYS, "USE THE GREEN DOOR."
^ : A BLUE BLEEB SAYS, "AVOID THE BLUE DOOR."
& : A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "AVOID THE RED DOOR."

2 : A LARGE BLEEB SITTING ON A THRONE HERE SAYS , "HELLO ADVENTURERS, WE 
BLEEBS ARE THE GUARDIANS OF THREE OF THE RINGS,YOU MUST ANSWER THREE 
QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE THEM."
3 : A RED BLEEB SAYS, "WHAT TYPE OF BLEEB SOMETIMES LIES AND SOMETIMES 
DOESN'T." 1-"BLUE" 2-"GREEN" 3-"RED"
4 : A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "IF TWO BLEEBS OF THE THE SAME COLOR DISAGREE 
THEY ARE WHICH COLOR." 1-"GREEN OR BLUE" 2-"RED" 3-"BLUE" 4-"RED OR 
GREEN"
5 : [APPLE:]A GREEN BLEEB SAYS, "WHAT TYPE OF BLEEB WOULD NEVER SAY THAT 
I SOMETIMES LIE." 1-"RED OR BLUE" 2-"RED" 3-"BLUE OR GREEN" 4-"GREEN" 5-
"BLUE"  The answer is 2 here.
    [COMMODORE:]  A blue bleeb says, What kind of bleeb would never say 
that it sometimes lies? red/blue, red, blue/green, green, blue.  The 
answer is #5(blue) here as well, really, but the Commodore accepts 2.  
WTF?!?!  Obviously red bleebs could lie and say that.  Green bleebs 
could tell the truth.  

Let's look at statements H-O.  Even removing M, N and O from 
consideration we can figure who does what.  Assume each of red, green, 
blue maps to truth, liars, and truth/liars.  If not then you can always 
assume someone may be a truth/liar unless a liar pins them as such.
** STATEMENT L with STATEMENT K means green bleebs can't tell the truth.
** Assume red bleebs tell the truth.  Then green bleebs are liars from 
statement H.  Consequently blue bleebs must tell lies some of the time.
** Look at statement L.  The green bleeb is telling the truth here, and 
we have a contradiction.
** Therefore blue bleebs are the truth-tellers, statement J pins red 
bleebs as liars, and green bleebs are "moderates."
Of course you could tell this from M, N and O(truth, lie and truth, 
pinning reds as liars and using statement H) but this way is more 
abstract and challenging.

Now for the puzzle of %/^/&.  The red bleeb, a liar, says use the green 
door.  The blue bleeb, a truth teller, says avoid the blue door.  So you 
use the red door.  On this occasion the durn two-faced green bleeb told 
you a stinkin' LIE!!

Now for the first puzzle I disagree with.  See T and U for the 
parameters.
-->The first bleeb is green.  He can't be red or he'd be telling the 
truth about his color.  Similarly he can't be blue or he'd be lying.  I 
think you can also assume that you shouldn't push red since the whole 
statement must be taken as a lie, but that's a fuzzy area.  It's not the 
first.
-->The second bleeb is red.  If he were blue, he'd be lying because 
there are two wrong answers;  "If I were red I would tell you to push 
the blue button."  However reds might tell you to push the red if the 
green were correct or green if the red were correct.  So reds wouldn't 
necessarily tell you to push the blue.  You're supposed to eliminate the 
red and blue but the logic isn't at all clear.
  Now "If I were red, I would tell you to push the blue button" is tough 
to figure out.  Is he giving instructions or just stating a fact?  It 
seems like the second, and if it is, then the blue button may be the 
right one to push.  It still works out.  Remember, he's lying about what 
he'd tell you to do--which would be lying.  The double negatives kick in 
here but we can't eliminate the green button from consideration either.  
Aigh.

The last puzzle is relatively easy.  See 3, 4, and 5 for the text.
**The first question you should know.  We've established that it's 2.
**The second is a bit tougher.  Obviously green works, but you may not 
have noticed that red works as well.  For instance you went through the 
red door to get here.  Red bleeb # 1 says "Go through the green door."  
Red bleeb # 2 says "Go through the blue door."  Both are lying, and they 
don't agree.
**The third is not too bad either.  "What type of bleeb would never tell 
the truth?"  The red.  2.  But it seems that this answer was not 
corrected in the translation to the Commodore, even though the bit about 
putting a blue bleeb instead of a green one in the blue room was.

POOL TRANSPORT
 u < - > v
 t = red pool that enables the pool at 6.
 x = red pool that enables the pool at 7.
 w = red pool that changes z's destination.
 6 < - > y once the pools are activated.
 7 < - > z once 7 is activated.
 z - > large room with many doors(SW) once you've jumped in pool w.
 (Note:  dashing around into all the non-blue pools you find will 
usually work.  The general guideline is that blue pools damage you, red 
pools activate green pools, and green pools may teleport.)
 If pools aren't activated, YOU JUST GET WET.

  "All right, you Dosnebians!  Let's break it up in there!"  Them 
Dosnebians are tough customers--a surly bunch--and you'll need to bust 
out the mad skillz to get past 'em.

OVERVIEW:  This one is pretty nasty.  First of all, the temple won't 
allow you in without a minotaur.  You probably haven't developed a 
minotaur, so you'll need a new one, and he should probably be a fighter.  
This effectively cuts your party down by one unless you want to spend 
time building him up--on the bright side he can get killed on the way 
here and they'll still let you in.  There are a lot of red herrings, and 
you may want to go through it twice.  Figuring out which statue to 
break(it's not obvious) or finding the short way to the cells is tough.  
You need to poke around a bit to find a key.  Then you may get in 
trouble when you do pick up the two rings.  This is the first dungeon 
with black knights in evidence.

Guard rooms in upper left and lower right.  Ordinary marble hallways at 
the entrance and by the jail cells.   Small stone hallways in the 
southeast and past the secret door.   There are four side chapels with 
statues to the side of the main temple and a chapel with wall painting 
to the south.  The casket room can be entered through the southeast.  A 
secret door in the temple leads to a small neat library and a cold damp 
stone hallway which continues past the prison above.  The cell block 
there has three small jail cells.  Way east of the temple you have the 
storage room, meeting room and guest bedroom on the left of the corridor 
with priests' rooms on the right.  A large dining room and kitchen face 
each other at the bottom.  There's a display room above them.

To get through, say "reven tonem" at the front door(if you goof, find 
the secret door to the right) and circle around.  Break the minotaur 
statue and go to the lower left secret door.  Follow the passage around 
and go north after the secret door.  Rescue Lord Wood(lowest cell) first 
and then everyone else.  Go up and the second door on the right has what 
you want.  You can leave through a door in the upper right.

OVERVIEW: Zeus's castle is not terribly hard to get through.  All the 
rooms are easily visible, and your progress is pretty much determined 
before you've even entered.  There are six rooms, each with a test your 
party must pass;  only one of these is an active test.  Once you pass 
them all, the door will open to visit Zeus in the bottom part.  Pray to 
him(attacking is a bad idea) and you will receive the God Rune.  This 
allows you to enter the final dungeon without fear.

You have a throne room of gold and silver below the strange misty 
hallway.

It should be clear what to do from the legend, but if not, make sure you 
have all four runes and nine rings.  These will help you pass five 
tests.  The dispell undead test should help you pass the combat test.

      ** LEGEND **

1 - room with heavy winds, where you pass if you got the air rune
2 - room with dirt floor, where you pass if you got the earth rune
3 - room of flame, where you pass if you got the fire rune
4 - small room full of mist, where you pass if you have all nine rings
5 - room of water, where you pass if you got the water rune
6 - small room full of mist, where you pass if you manage to defeat the 
following monsters:
  ! - high devil.
  @ - spirit.
Z - Zeus.  You will have an option of discourse with him but it's best 
to pray.

OVERVIEW:  there aren't a lot of dead ends or pitfalls, but your party 
had better be good because there are lots of demons hanging around.  
Without the God Rune they won't get through the first door but then they 
need to search around for the teleporter to the right side where they 
must chase the Black Lord.  If they rip up enough stuff they'll get to 
him, after which they can attack him.  Filmon the sage may help out if 
you make a wrong turn.

Until the very end you walk through a bunch of dark eerie stone passages 
connecting guard rooms.  The far east has "inside a fissure in the 
earth" and below it is a simple throne room.  You are sent to a strange 
misty room after you accomplish your mission.  There's a teleport in one 
of the lower passages that leads to a very linear endgame.

To get through this level, hang a left when you hit the wall.  Keep 
pushing down and left until you can't any more.  The passages down and 
to the right will lead to a teleporter.  Fight through some more 
combats, destroy the gems, gold and throne, and keep pushing up.  At the 
intersection you want to attack the Black Lord.  You can go north to 
recover the wand.

C : encounter with black knights
D : encounter with water elementals
E : encounter with spirits
F : encounter with high devil
G : encounter with high demon/bantirs
S and Y teleport back to one square above each other.

d : An old man sitting in the corner says "My friends I am Filmon the 
sage.  You have three options:" 1-leave cave 2-fight lord 3-think over
  [1 or 2:] ' A WISE DECISION MY FRIENDS ' SAYS      FILMON AS HE 
MOTIONS WITH HIS HANDS AND HE CASTS A SPELL. PARTY IS TELEPORTATED [1: 
south of fissure, 2: south of entrance]
1 : WHEN YOU ENTER THIS LARGE ROOM YOU ARE ATTACKED BY BLACK KNIGHTS. A 
LARGE FIGURE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM GETS UP OFF A THRONE AND RUNS OUT 
[encounter with black knights]
2 : THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF GOLD HERE. 1-TAKE IT 2-DESTROY IT
 [2:] IT IS DESTROYED.

4 : THERE IS A LARGE EMPTY THRONE HERE. 1-SIT IN IT 2-DESTROY IT 3-LEAVE
 [1: party takes damage]
 [2:] IT IS DESTROYED.
5 : You see the black lord several feet ahead of you.  He waves his wand 
and a lightning bolt comes forth toward you. [party takes damage]
6 : THE BLACK LORD IS STANDING HERE AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE WAITING 
FOR YOU. 1: ATTACK HIM 2: WAIT 3: BRIBE HIM
  [1, having destroyed gold and gems:]  THE BLACK LORD WAVES HIS WAND 
AND CASTS A SPELL.  THE EARTH TREMBLES AND SPLITS INTO A NORTH-SOUTH 
FISSURE.  HE TOSSES HIS WAND TO THE NORTH AND RUNS SOUTH.
7 : The wand is here.  1-destroy it 2-wave it 3-think
  [1: party takes mega damage]
  [2: sent to Filmon's in the center]
  [2 or 3, or without destroying gold/gems:]  HE CASTS A SPELL WITH HIS 
WAND AND DISAPPEARS.
l : After defeating the Black Lord, you are transported to Olympus and 
read Zeus saying "WELL DONE, MY SMALL FRIENDS. YOU HAVE REMOVED A GREAT 
EVIL FROM GELNOR. YOUR QUEST IS OVER, NOW GO AND REST TO PREPARE YOU FOR 
THE NEXT ADVENTURE. I GRANT YOU YOUR FIRST DIVINE SPELL. YOU WILL LEARN 
LATER HOW TO USE IT PROPERLY."  [PC version has "in Phantasie II" tacked 
on to it.  This is a bit ironic, as there never was a Phantasie II for 
the PC, only for the Commodore, which doesn't have this.]

  CHEATING

    Tsk, tsk.  This section contains spoilers so please be careful.

    First of all I should mention that cheating attributes up to a 
ridiculous level can backfire.  You may not be able to learn spells, and 
training may cost 15000 gold for the first level;  cost of training 
varies with the abilities you've acquired.  Improving attributes to 99 
and skills to 255 also frequently caused the Apple version to flip out 
when I went into encounters.  I recommend 40 across the board and giving 
one person 255 skills.

    Even though the Apple does not work, understanding it will help you 
to capture a wrinkle with the Commodore.  I consider the starting offset 
for each character to be at the place where the name starts.  This makes 
it easier to search for the character's name in a hex dump as the names 
appear on the hex dump.  I suspect that the information for the 
character starts at 0x83 before the name itself.  Each character takes 
up 170(0xaa) bytes and the characters are often(about 170/256 of the 
time) spread out over different sectors.  On the Apple, sectors cycle as 
follows:

start at y000 -> y700 -> ye00 -> y600 -> yd00 -> y500 -> yc00 -> y400 -> 
yb00 -> y300 -> ya00 -> y200 -> y900 -> z000

(this is standard for BASIC and also assisted my text-mapping of the 
game's various areas.)

    If a character is broken in two sectors and you can't figure it out 
just see where the previous/next slot's sector is and change the hex 
value accordingly.  For instance if a character's name starts at x36f0 
and you want to change something x14 bytes ahead, d is the sector after 
6 so you'd look in 0x3d04.  However if the name started at 0x3610 and 
you wanted to change something 0x62 behind, then e is the sector before 
6.  0x3eae would be the byte to edit.

    For the Commodore it is a bit trickier.  If going back would cause 
you to skip a boundary you have to, in addition to changing sectors, 
move backwards another two bytes.  That is because in each 256-byte 
block the Commodore has two initializing bytes at the beginning.  
Alternatively you can just move up from the start.  In any case numbers 
appear to be ac/54 away from each other instead of aa/56 away.  In 
addition, the sectors jump around a bit more randomly with the 
Commodore.  I created a bunch of characters named "AA01" through "AA21" 
and was able to produce the byte values.

    On the Apple, for characters 38-40 you have fire, water and earth 
elementals.  These characters are 22-24 on the Commodore.

Here's where to start the hacking in case you can't remember the slot 
names.

Here are the bytes to hack in a hex editor.  Search for the name if you 
forget the slot.  Note the "from name start" negative values.  I've 
sometimes put notes there but if there aren't any just change the hex 
byte to the desired value.  I'd generally advise not giving more than 
99(x63) as three-digit numbers could goof up the display slightly.

7 = OGRE
8 = GNOLL
9 = TROLL
a = KOBOLD
b = ORC
c = GOBLIN
d = LIZARD MAN
e = MINOTAUR
f = UNDEAD

You can save a game, change to a certain race, and back, which may help 
for certain puzzles.

To change a special item(less risky than outright editing) you can do 
the following:
  1) buy scroll 1(easy to find)
  2) open up the image in a hex editor.  Just after your character's 
name there should be the number x79 with descending numbers after it.  
That is scroll 1.
  3) add to that number.  To see scroll 14, add 0xd, i.e. put 0x86.  
Save the game.  You can now read scroll x86.
  See my section on special items to get any other item you want.  Of 
course you can do this to more than one item at a time and even get ring 
nine this way.

  There is also a less technical process for duplicating items.

  Shay Addams's "Quest for Clues" describes the process as follows, 
although first you will need to make a backup "dummy" disk.  If you have 
an emulator, this is not hard, and in fact you can try this trick with 
two backups first so you don't ruin your main game if something goes 
wrong:

    1.  enter town A
    2.  sell off the items you want to duplicate
    3.  teleport to town B
    4.  remove main disk, insert dummy
    5.  teleport to town C
    6.  remove dummy, insert main disk
    7.  teleport to town A
    8.  buy the new items that have mysteriously appeared in the town 
armory's inventory!

  ERRATA

    You can bring a fighter over from, say, Olympia to Pelnor with just 
the two month delay--never mind that he couldn't make it by himself!
    The world of Phantasie is very modern.  Not only do you have roads 
well in advance of other RPG's, but there are banks.  And they even have 
bank fees!  That's right.  Every time you distribute the gold(which you 
must do when you enter a town) the gold gets rounded down to the nearest 
multiple of the total number of shares.  In fact you may even find that, 
if you try to split up 6000 gold equally among 6 people, you wind up 
with 999 gold each.  Too bad society isn't advanced enough to have 
consumer advocacy!
    I've mentioned the Northford bug(when rotated, it's on the south 
shore) and there's also a flaky scroll with a slight misdirection.  But 
overall they do a good job of porting everything over.

VERSIONS/CREDITS

1.0.0 submitted to GameFAQs.com on 12/20/2001.  I believe this is a very 
adequate first draft although I imagine errors always seem to leak 
through.

Thanks to theunderdogs.org for the manual and PC images, 
project64.c64.org, ftp://arnold.c64.org, ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net, 
Evin's Apple Emulator Page(which is sadly part down now) and Delorie GPP 
freeware that allowed me to extract information from the files.  Also 
kahei's hex editor(www.kahei.com) helped me to locate lots of data.

Shay Addams's _Quest for Clues_ book was invaluable when it came to 
checking my work.  I frequently referred to it and although I have not 
directly quoted anything from it besides the duplication cheat, it has 
still been a huge help and has probably influenced my solution in ways 
unimaginable.  At the very least it saved me a lot of time as a great 
reference guide.
