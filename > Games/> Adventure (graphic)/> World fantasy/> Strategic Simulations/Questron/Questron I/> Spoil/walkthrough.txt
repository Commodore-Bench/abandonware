INTRODUCTION

    Questron is very tough.  It can be unforgiving, although at least it 
doesn't auto-save when you die.  Well, for my first revision I want to 
get down to meat, so let's roll out the maps.

TOWN INFO

    You have to be careful in towns.  Talking to prisoners or robbing or 
winning too much money at gambling will set the guards after you.  
Nevertheless towns are a whole lot safer than the outside world and 
frequently have stuff that can help you.

    Currently the town info for Questron is of the following format:
    Armor Sellers/Food Sellers/Gambling/Weapons/Transport/[multiplier]

    Currently the town info for the Land of Evil is of the following 
format:
    Name
    Armor Sellers/Food Sellers/Gambling/Weapons or 
Transport/Spells/[multiplier]

      The standard prices for things in Questron are listed in the items 
section.  To get the price at any one town, multiply by the multiplier.

    I've also written out rough text maps for every town in Questron.  A 
rough ledger is below.

      LEDGER
      X = wall(or water.  This map doesn't distinguish but probably 
should...if there is a "next release" of this FAQ)
      C = 3/4 wall
      . = grassy square
[space] = open square
      G = guard
      ! = merchant
      F = food store sign
      W = weapons store sign
      A = armor store sign
      M = magic store sign
      + = small bush
      * = big bush
    |,- = doors to keep prisoners in
    /,\ = 1/2-walls sloping in one direction or the other

    Mountain Catacombs(39E, 21N)
      Located around the center of the continent.  It's behind mountains 
and fog, so you'll need the trumpet to get in.

    Dungeon of Death(60E, 7S)
      Located in the southeast.  You need the Iron Key to get past the 
gate.

    Mantor's Mountain(70E, 73N)
      Located in the northeast on a skull-shaped island.  You need an 
eagle to get here, since you can't bring a wam lamma on a clipper ship.  
You also need the Diamond Ring to remove the boulder.

MONSTER INFO

There are lots of monsters in Questron.  The full details will appear in 
a later version of this FAQ, but here are the monsters you'll meet above 
ground in Questron:

--ARMY SCORPION
--FLESH FEELER
--BLOODHOUND GHOUL
--GORILLA
--WOODS OGRE
--BEAR
--IRISH STALKER
--LEOPARD YETI
--JACKAL RAM
--PHAZOR SPIDER
--STONE AXE BEAK
--GAR MIND FLAYER
--ALBINO LEACH
--ROT WEED
--STRANGLER FIEND
--PIT SCREAMER
--HYDRO SNAKE
--MASHER WHALE
--LEACH WOMAN
--SLIME SWIMMER
--PIERCING PUNGIE

WEAPON, ARMOR, ITEM AND TRANSPORT INFO

Here are the possible weapons, ranged in order of effectiveness, with 
prices in parentheses:
--BARE HANDS(not really a weapon, but it indicates the lack thereof)
--SLING(8)
--WHIP(13)
--ROPE & HOOKS(26)
--MORNINGSTAR(35)
--FLAIL(50)
--CLUB(70)
--MACE(90)
--HAMMER & NET(130)
--CUTLASS(180)
--SHORT BOW(700)
--BATTLE AXE(900)
--LANCE(1250)
--BROAD SWORD(1700)
--LONG BOW(1950)
--MUSKET(2200)
Their availability seems to depend on your time in the game and how many 
monsters you've defeated.  When I rushed through the game, although I 
got a million gold, 20000 hit points, etc. I never got more than a short 
bow.
The Rope&Hooks doubles as a way to climb up a shaft or climb down one 
without taking damage due to falling.
Short bow and Long bow have range, which is useful in dungeons.  
However, they can't be used outside dungeons, at least not in hand-to-
hand combat.  [can you shoot guards at a range?]
Strange that a club is more effective than a flail.  Usually it's the 
other way around.

Here are the possible armors, from least to most effective:
--NO ARMOUR(not really armor, but it indicates the lack thereof)
--RAWHIDE(25)
--SHIELD(65)
--CHAIN MAIL(110)
--PLATE MAIL(175)
--MAGIC SHIELD(900)
--ENCHANTED PLATE(1500)
Their availability seems to depend on your time in the game and how many 
monsters you've defeated.  When I rushed through the game, although I 
got a million gold, 20000 hit points, etc. I never got more than plate 
mail.

Flute:  Play it and get weapon/armor/food/gold
Compass:  when you (H)old it, you see what direction you're going in a 
dungeon.
Ruby Key:  1st key you find in the castle
Silver Key:  2nd key you find in castle
Emerald Key:  3rd key you find in castle
Lead Key:  4th key you find in castle
Gold key: 5th key you find in the castle.  After the king knights you, 
it can open all castle doors, including those only a previous key could 
have opened.
Magic powder:  you can have more than one.  It weakens either Mantor or 
the guards at Mesron's castle but not both.

Here are the possible transports.  I'm not sure about the speeds, but I 
know they increase:
HORSE:  lowest form of transport.  2x as fast as walking
WAM LAMMA:  better than a horse.  Can pass mountains but not swamps.  2x 
as fast as walking
RAFT:  can pass water.  2x as fast as walking
CLIPPER:  can pass water.  4x as fast as walking
TRAINED EAGLE:  can pass all terrain.  4x as fast as walking

WALKTHROUGH, WITH INTERIOR MAPS

  GETTING BETTER

    Once you get chain mail, Mesron will call.  I also think Geraldtown 
is destroyed by Mantor at that time.  Cathedrals will help you improve 
some stats, but most are hard-coded for improvement at the castles.  For 
instance, the king and Mesron give you stamina, and the princess gives 
you charisma.  Even after you improve dexterity at the Swamp Cathedral, 
you get 40 dexterity hard-coded once you solve a quest.
    You can actually get worse, too.  Some monsters drain stamina or 
intelligence, which don't seem to mean much anyway.  Intelligence can be 
improved again, but I'm not sure stamina can.  All in all, statistical 
improvement is a serious muddle.

    LEGALLY

    Truth be told, I'm not sure how to do this, but be careful.  
Fighting monsters is a good way to improve, and you'll probably find 
that investments like armor(you take less damage) and transportation(you 
take less time and hence less food) are hardly wasted.  Also, save 
frequently, and, once you've reached a certain point, never save after 
you're killed.  You're set back to something ungodly like 200 HP, 57 
food, and 15 gold.  You lose your weapons but not your armor.
    If you make it to Ocean Point cathedral, using the flute can be 
quite handy.  It will get you food, weapons, armor or gold, and you can 
recharge it after its three uses are up.  Camp out beside Ocean Point, 
and you may have a real racket going.

    ILLEGALLY

    There's a nice Geraldtown/Swamp Cathedral racket before Geraldtown 
gets nuked.  What you'll want to do is to keep playing Double or Nothing 
until you are told "Gambling closed."  If you have an emulator, you can 
simply slow it down(maximize emulator delay) at the start of the game 
and time things so that you hit return just as the game is about to 
switch from "LOSE" to "WIN."  Doing so can double your return.  When 
gambling's closed, run out of there--the guards are after you, so be 
careful--and to Swamp Cathedral.  Re-enter immediately and the guards 
will attack you, so you need to give them time to forget, and you need 
to give yourself hit points.  At the cathedral, give 150 gold, get two 
holy waters, go back to Geraldtown, try again(when you get in four-digit 
wealth, you can only double once before gambling closes.)  Eventually 
you'll come closer to doubling your stake each time, and until 
Geraldtown is destroyed this is a great way to get money.  Don't forget 
to buy incidental food as well, but don't worry about arms and weapons 
until you're quite good and have spare holy water stacked up--you'll 
need the holy water for the castle.  The longer you can hold out on 
buying it, the quicker doubling goes, too.  Two vials a trip should be 
enough to ward off guards that attack.

    Geraldtown is not the only place with Double or Nothing.  Later in 
the game, when you can leave the guards in the dust because you've got 
over 500 hit points, you can get to a million before you break the bank:  
"Sorry, we're out of funds."  A million should be way more than enough 
to pull you through the game.  However, thirty thousand and a hundred 
fifty holy waters(the maximum is 200, I think) should get you ready for 
Mesron and the King's Castle.

  SIGHTS TO SEE

    SWAMP CATHEDRAL

    Swamp Cathedral is a great place to increase your dexterity.  The 
video game, which costs fifty gold, is tough to handle off an emulator 
because it uses joystick controls, but using the keypad(4/6/8/DEL) can 
make it work--you just need to time how far objects fall and how they 
arc.  The scoring is as follows:
--100 for shooting a white
--50 for shooting a red, blue, orange or green
--500 for shooting 2 in a session
--2500 for shooting 3 in a session(this is the biggie!)
--dexterity changed to (score/500)

I can usually get dexterity over thirty playing this game.

    Giving X gold to the priest allows you to get (X/75) vials of Holy 
Water, which improve your Hit Points by 100 each.  Early in the game 
your maximum stamina is only 500.

    OCEAN POINT CATHEDRAL

    There's a flute on the east side.  Using it gets you emergency 
supplies of food, armor or weapons.  After three times the flute must be 
recharged at Ocean Point.  You can also buy hit points here.

    ISLAND CATHEDRAL

    You'll need a raft to get here.  Once you do, there's a bit of an 
intelligence test.  There are two ways to get through it.  One involves 
saving state in an emulator after starting a game, and then, after you 
see what the pattern is, inputting it on the first try(Doing this 
correctly IS A sign of intelligence, you have to admit.)  The other 
involves a different sort of abstract thinking.

    Basically, there are six squares and the administrator of the game 
has put four squares of orange, blue, green and yellow color on them--
there are four possible colors, but they can be in any frequency.  You 
have eight guesses to figure out the order they're in.  After each 
guess, you are given a white for each square that is the right color and 
the right position but grey for each square that is the right color and 
wrong position.
    Get the answer in <=4 guesses:  +20 points
    Get the answer in 5 guesses:  +16 points
    Get the answer in 6 guesses:  +12 points
    Get the answer in 7 guesses:  +8 points
    Get the answer in 8 guesses:  +4 points
    Don't get the answer:  -1 points and "What a waste of a good 
chance!"  That's even worse than the "You got careless" you'll see in 
the dungeon.

    Sample:
    Your guess  Actual
    +-+-+       +-+-+
    |Y|Y|       |Y|O|
    +-+-+       +-+-+
    | | |       | |G|
    +-+-+       +-+-+
    |G|G|       | |B|
    +-+-+       +-+-+

    In this case, you'd get a white(upper left, yellow) and a grey(the G 
in the middle is not on the same square as your G's.)
    I think I nailed down a fairly decent strategy.  The first couple of 
moves are fixed, but after three moves you should know the composition 
of the pegs as well as some positioning information.

    +-+-+       +-+-+
    |O|O|       |Y|Y|
    +-+-+       +-+-+
    |Y|Y|       | | |
    +-+-+       +-+-+
    | | |       |B|B|
    +-+-+       +-+-+

    From these first two guesses, we should learn the total of 
(orange+yellow) or (yellow+blue) pegs.  If we have three of one sort, we 
won't know that, but that will be made obvious by the next guess in any 
case, and having three of one color makes the guessing much easier.
    Let's say the first guess gives a white and grey peg.  The second 
gives a grey peg.  You know that:
    # of O's + # of Y's = 2
    # of B's + # of Y's = 1
    Let's assume that there's no more than three of any one quantity.
    Now, since O+Y = 2, B+G=2.  So if you try each case(B=0, B=1) you 
see:
    (O, Y, G, B) = (1, 1, 2, 0)
    (O, Y, G, B) = (2, 0, 1, 1)
    The other possibility is (O, Y, G, B) = (3, 1, 0, 0).
    One next step would be to go with four oranges--for the first four 
guesses, you're trying to gather information, not get the answer off the 
bat, and this one definitively tells you the color composition.  One 
step is to put the oranges as below:

    +-+-+
    |O|O|
    +-+-+
    |O|O|
    +-+-+
    | | |
    +-+-+

    You now have strong information about where any O's might be.  Some 
guesses may be very revealing--for instance, a single grey will tell you 
that there is an O in the bottom two rows, and looking at the first 
guess tells you that there is a yellow in the middle two rows.  There 
are also two greens, and so you will be able to start guessing rather 
efficiently.  A guess with four greens would also be good.  Often you'll 
have to put together information from several clues to get a full 
answer, so homogenous choices are not the best.  This was just written 
to give you a taste of the logic.  Besides, even if you do strike out a 
few times in a row, you don't have to SAVE the game after losing 
intelligence. :D


    This game is not easy.  That's why there's so little punishment for 
losing.  Just practice, and if in doubt, you may want to use the 
following sort of chart:
    +--+--+
    |OY|OY|
    |GB|GB|
    +--+--+
    |OY|OY|
    |GB|GB|
    +--+--+
    |OY|OY|
    |GB|GB|

    Cross out a letter when it can't be in a certain square(for 
instance, if you get greys in the first chart above, feel free to knock 
the O's from the top and the Y's from the middle.)

    Once you're over forty intelligence, you can't play again.  
Therefore, if you want to be slightly unfair, bump your intelligence up 
to 39, start a new game, save the emulator state, play through it, 
reload, and type in the correct pattern to win on your first turn and 
get +20 intelligence.  So 59 is the maximum intelligence you can get.

THE CASTLE

  LEDGER

    W = water
    w = water
    X = castle wall
    x = inner wall/locked door
    $ = gold chest
    % = chest with key
    ^ = chest with trumpet
    ! = guard
    1 = king
    2 = princess
    3 = Mesron
    4 = doctor

    In order to fit within 79 characters I divided the castle map into 
the left and right portions.  The first, the left(or west,) has three 
keys.  The keys are determined by the order you pick them up in:  ruby, 
silver, lead and emerald is the order regardless of which box you open 
when.  One-square enclaves are often teleporters and should only be used 
in desperation.

    The very first thing you'll want to do is to go east and take the 
first passage north.  Talk to Mesron.  He'll raise you to the rank of 
Soldier and increase your stats, too.
    There are about forty-two soldiers in here, in case you want to keep 
track of how much you have left to go.

    The main thing here is to get three keys.  You'll want to go west 
after you enter, then all the way up.  The first key is, like the 
others, in an enclosed area.  The guards will attack once you steal 
something, so you want to find places where only one can hit you at a 
time.  You may want to walk down the corridor leading south from the 
first key, get guards to follow you, and move back up.  They'll have to 
attack you one at a time, so even if you get low on hit points, you can 
use your holy water(which you should be (H)olding to (O)perate) to heal 
up quickly.  One guard can't do that much damage.  Once the guards are 
reasonably cleared out, go east of where the long corridor begins and 
onto the o's(where guards can't attack you) and get the two keys to the 
east there.  There are six guards or so, and there's no real way to stop 
double attacks.  Back off onto the o's and use holy water, then go back.  
If you are able to kill a guard, jump in where he was and the guards 
should be lined up one by one.  The very top part is a nuisance even 
though it's full of gold.  I believe the computer may automatically dump 
eight guards below the o's if you pick up the gold in the small treasure 
rooms.  But if you just want the keys, go north from the o's and then 
east.  On the right side of the map, you'll see two enclaves--again, the 
key is that the floor looks a bit different--and each contains a key.  
The fifth will be a gold key and will allow you to visit the king.  
There is also, when you enter the castle and go north past the 
courtyard, a doctor to the west(where the tiles form "Rx") who will 
increase your stats.

    Mesron is to the east, as is the king.  However, it may be best 
first just to visit the princess(north of the courtyard, second door to 
the east) to improve your charisma as well as the room below it, where 
there's a chest with 2000 gold.  Both need the keys, which is why I 
suggested going west first.  However, after visiting the princess, go 
north and east until you hit a dead end.  Open the door with a gold key 
and use the backing-up strategy if you must.  There are a lot of guards, 
and facing two at a time will be too much.  Once they are all wiped out, 
you can walk through a door to the bottom right of the room, where a 
chest holds the trumpet.  You'll need to leave the castle and come back 
to talk to the king.  He'll give you 15 stamina and raise your rank 
again.

  LAND OF EVIL

  To get to the land of Evil, go any direction from Questron.  The 
110x110 maps are tiled like a checkerboard, so going straight in any 
direction from one half of the world leads to the other half.  In fact, 
once you get an eagle, it may be faster to fly southwest from the 
southwest corner to reach Mantor's Mountain than across land--it may be 
easier to get lost, though.

  In the Land of Evil, the main things to find, overground, are:

  1)cities where you can stock up on spells and hit points
  2)dungeons where you can pile up hit points and gold(raid level one 
continuously, leave, etc.)

  A word of warning:  my dungeon maps are not perfect.  I believe I have 
correctly indicated all spaces where you can ascend or descend a level, 
and I have made an effort to find all walls, doors, etc.  I have tried 
to mark all traps;  my maps are likely inaccurate in this respect, but 
they get better as you get closer to the end.

  With regard to dungeons:  fireball spells are the best to use.  Wall 
Pass spells are also quite good, and a few armor protection spells don't 
hurt either.  They will save lots of hit points on the lower levels.  In 
any case, bring some extra armor and be sure to re-equip when you see 
you're absorbing many more hit points than you should.  The wall pass 
spells actually aren't necessary to complete the game;  they will, 
however, save considerable headache on some levels.  An example is the 
eight level of the mountain catacombs--used judiciously on two squares, 
they make it very easy.  In fact, it might be another flagrant example 
of cheating, but you may be able to move from level to level through the 
walls without worrying about being hit.

Ledger for dungeons:

    o = hole to climb down(need rope to avoid damage, may be concealed 
as a trap)
    ~ = hole to climb up(need to (A)rm rope and then (C)limb)
    R = rope to climb up
    r = rope to climb down
    D = door
    ^ = stairs up
    v = stairs down
    + = coffin(gain hit points)
    t = trap(random, push x to "see" it)
    u = urn(usually has a message)
    F = chest with food
    $ = chest with money
    - = urn that lowers your stats
    P = chest with powder

Most likely errata:  $ may be F or + or P.

Traps are especially nasty because they can:
  1)blind you for a few moves
  2)reduce hit points and destroy armor(acid)
  3)take lots of hit points(poison gas or darts)
  4)drop you to the next level(you can then (X)amine and climb back up)

There are also several messages you can find in urns, and as none is a 
spoiler, all are listed below:
--LADDER & ROPES ARE NOT THE ONLY WAY
--BE RID QUICKLY OF THE APPARITION
--THE GHOSTS CAN BE ESPECIALLY DEADLY
--ONLY A FOOL GOES WITHOUT A ROPE
--THE FIREBALL KILLS QUICKLY AND EASILY
--A FROZEN TREAT IS EASY TO BEAT
--MANTOR RULES THE MONSTERS HERE
--MONSTERS IN SIGHT? USE MAGIC TO FIGHT
--MANTOR'S MOUNTAIN IS A ONE-WAY TRIP
--MANTOR WAITS AT THE BOTTOM FOR YOU

    You'll probably find a compass somewhere around here in a chest.  
I'm pretty sure the location is constant, but if not, it's a good idea 
to search the top two levels--the Atari walkthrough mentioned that you 
found the compass on the second level.  (H)olding the compass will 
activate the indicator in the bottom left of your screen.  Five east, 
four south, west, south, (S)teal chest, west, two south, four east, 
three south, down.
    If you find yourself getting killed too easily, just explore the 
first dungeon level, mark where the gold and hit points are, get them, 
exit, and go back in.  You can do this until you "max out," and it's 
relatively painless.  Then with the extra gold, just go to a town and 
buy spells.

    Of the three ropes down, only the middle one will get you to the 
next level without a wall pass.  Traps start to get nasty here, and 
they're not well mapped here, so be sure to (X)amine as you search for

Congratulations!  You've found the Iron Key, which will let you into the 
Dungeon of Death.  Just retrace your steps, and you're on your way.

    DUNGEON OF DEATH[WITH MAPS]

SYNOPSIS:  This dungeon is probably the easiest of the three because 
there is a slick way to bypass most of the traditional dungeon travel 
and mapping(well, I still did all that for you, but you're not the one 
who likes to write FAQs.)  The lower right corner has a set of slides 
all the way down to level six, and from there it is not hard to get to 
the bottom--where you need to run to the safe, get the diamond 
ring(which allows access to Mantor's Mountain) and get out quickly the 
same way you got in.  You may have a false start or two, but it's going 
to be less painful than the first, especially since you get used to the 
nuances and (in my opinion) the control flaws in the game.

    From the top left, go five east, cast wall, go all the way east, go 
south, and cast two more wall spells.  West, three south, east, and now 
(X)amine to the south, (A)rm yourself with rope, and repeatedly (C)limb 
and (X)amine.  If you forget to (X)amine, you'll fall down and lose 
about a thousand hit points.  I've eliminated detailed walkthroughs for 
levels 2-5, although level 4 may be of interest if you've lost your 
magic powder, as you need that stuff to win the game.

    You may also want to get the gold(five east, two south, five west) 
and then the coffin(two east, two south, and four east,) exit, and 
repeat.  This can improve your character very quickly at little risk.

    There's some magic powder on this level, so when you climb in/out of 
the dungeon, you may want to cast a wall spell north from the bottom 
right corner.  Go through the door and each enclave on the left contains 
the magic powder.  You can leave and return to these spots in the 
dungeon again.  You'll probably need to do this just three times if 
you're out of powder, as Mantor requires about five hits.  Note that you 
get the added bonus of money and hit points as a coffin and chest are 
close by.

    There are a lot of traps in the bottom half of the level I haven't 
documented.  However, our walkthrough is only concerned with going 
north, then west, casting a wall spell, and getting to the stairs.  You 
can also use two wall spells by going north, casting a wall spell, 
getting the coffin, and casting a wall spell south.

    It's pretty smooth sailing to go east, two south, two east, four 
north, west, three north, east, four north, and all the way west.  But 
if you've got extra wall spells, just blast through two walls to the 
north and go west.  Face east before climbing down to make your trip 
that much smoother.

    Run the gauntlet here.  Six east, followed by turning left and 
backing up nine squares.  I'm pretty sure you can steal the safe with 
monsters in view, but if not, just back up two more squares, blow all 
the monsters away, go forward two, steal, and reverse all your steps to 
get out of the dungeon.

    MANTOR'S MOUNTAIN[WITH MAPS]

SYNOPSIS:  This dungeon is very tough, even if it is a bit smaller than 
the other two(17*9*9=1377 squares, as opposed to 8*14*14=1568) as there 
are some really nasty monsters on the lower levels.  Although you can 
win any one fight, the odds seem to indicate that you'll wind up 
fighting a bunch of monsters on some level, which can drag down your hit 
points.  I've tried to outline the shortest way through the levels that 
also allows you to replenish hit points.

    Wall spell, two east.  You might want to pick up the coffin in front 
of you before going down, and you can do this by (X)amining for traps 
after going one square west.  The roundabout way(three north, east, 
north, steal coffin, north, two west, south, three west, four south, 
east, steal coffin, down) has the added virtue of getting you another 
coffin for hit points.

    I had an Air Golem offer to show me the hidden door to the safe as I 
exited--for 1041000 gold.  I suspect that he asks for your gold pieces, 
rounded down to the nearest thousand.  As you are about to win the game, 
you don't really need the excess dough, so cough it up.  Two east and 
four south, you'll find the safe, which you'll need to unock facing 
north.  You will reveal a hole, which you must climb down, and you'll be 
in a space vaguely similar to Mesron's castle.  Perhaps Armor 
Enhancement might not be a bad idea here, but at any rate you should 
ready a cutlass as long and short bows don't work above ground in close 
combat.
    You'll probably need 10000 or so hit points to get through this.  

    THE FINAL BATTLE

    The last part of this game is really rather exciting, and after what 
you've been through, you probably deserve some entertainment.

    Well, once you find the safe or fall through, there are a bunch of 
guards waiting for you.  You're in the center of the bottom room, just 
below the water.  They're pretty upset with you and ready to attack.  
You don't want them attacking from both sides, so take the corner, or 
failing that, a wall, and duke it out.  Progress slowly along the 
corridors, as there is no time limit, and never hesitate to double back 
to goad guards to attack you singly.  There's a green-and-orange room 
that you can avoid, but once you make it all the way north you'll need 
the gold key to unlock two rooms, protected by purple blocks.  Open the 
left one first and use the powder a lot.  You don't even have to 
approach Mantor  It will eventually kill Mantor.  You now have the book, 
so open the right door.  Get next to the computer and (H)old the book 
and (O)perate it.  Boom--there goes the computer.  Then go back to where 
Mantor stood(the purple enclave) and (O)perate the book again to 
teleport back home.  Back at the castle, talk to the king, and talk to 
Mesron.  Enjoy the finale.

  QUICK REHASH OF THE WALKTHROUGH

  1.  Get good enough so that Mesron calls you(get chain mail)
  2.  At the castle, talk to Mesron, find five keys, beat up all the 
guards, get the trumpet and leave.
  3.  Talk to the king.
  4.  Solve the Mountain Catacombs--get the Iron Key
  5.  Solve the Dungeon of Death--get the Diamond Ring
  6.  Solve Mantor's Mountain--below level 17, waste all his guards, 
destroy him and his computer.
  7.  Enjoy the cool denouement.

RANKS

   BARON--awarded at the end of the game
   KNIGHT--awarded when you steal the trumpet
   SOLDIER--awarded when you meet Mesron
   PAGE--????
   SERF--how you start off

OOPS!

--Flee from a sea creature when you're in the water.  It will occupy the 
land square you are trying to flee to.  You can see a similar bug for a 
land-based creature by the sea.

AND FINALLY...

"STAY OUT OF WALLS!"  "YOU GOT CARELESS!"  Damned dungeon engine.

1.5.0 Sent in second version 7/4/2001 instead of being patriotic or 
something, but I put the text maps in.
1.0.0 Sent first version to GameFAQs 6/19/2001--still need to create 
town and cathedral text maps.  Castle and dungeon text maps are in 
place, however.

ftp.apple.asimov.net--the site has EVERYTHING.  Well, almost.
project64.c64.org for the documentation to this game
gamexperts.com for the original anonymous walkthrough, which certainly 
made things easier.  But I did all the maps and town info by myself.
