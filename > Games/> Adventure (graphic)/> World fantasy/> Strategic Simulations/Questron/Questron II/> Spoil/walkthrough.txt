INTRODUCTION

    There are two big land masses you'll have to navigate.  Don't worry 
about the second until you've become an apprentice.  You'll want to 
avoid combat if you can, as it doesn't really get you much gold and can 
be harmful.  Casinos are better.
    You need a boat or an eagle or a special item to make it from one 
land to another.  However, the world is tiled like a checkerboard with 
the 90x90 maps of Landor and the Sorcerers' Realm.

GETTING GOOD QUICKLY

  GAMBLING

    Blackjack doesn't have 100% payout, so don't play it.  There are 
plenty of Blackjack FAQs, so I'll summarize briefly--you start with two 
hole cards.  Ace is worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable, and KQJ 
are worth ten, and number cards are worth their value.  You may "hit" 
(draw another card) until you go over 21, when you "bust"(lose.)  The 
objective is to beat the dealer--if you bust, the dealer wins 
automatically.  If you draw to a 21, you have blackjack and win 250% 
instead of 200%.
    High/Low has a 100% payout, since it's equally probably a card will 
be 2-7 or 9/10/JQKA, so I suppose you could save before playing(it's 
nice that you can save in towns) and try.
    Wizard's Squares is the best.  You win six times your money(i.e. bet 
100, get 700--technically, they present the game incorrectly, but the 
game is better for you than advertised!) if you guess the square the 
ball lands on, three times(bet 100, get 400) if you're one off, and 
nothing if you lose.  Let's break it down.

    If you choose the c square, there is a 1/16 change you'll be 
right(you get 7 times your original stake and a 1/16 chance the ball 
will land on the a square next to it.  Total winnings = 7*1/16+4*1/16 = 
11/16, or a 68.75% payout.  Almost as bad as Lotto tickets.
    If you choose the b square, you have a 1/16 chance of guessing 
right, and there's a 2/16 change the ball will land on an adjacent a 
square.  Payout = 7*1/16+4*2/16 = 93.75%.  Not bad!
    If you choose the a square, you have a 1/16 chance of guessing 
right, and there's a 4/16 chance the ball will land on an adjacent 
square, two b and two c.  Payout = 7*1/16+4*4/16 = 143.75%.
    All c, b and a squares are identical--you can use a simple 
symmetry/rotational argument to prove this.
    So if you bet a portion of your current boodle, you can usually win 
nicely.  But there's a way to win even bigger.  It involves cheating.
    Use "save state" on an emulator just when you're asked to choose 
which square.  Then pick any one, see where the ball lands, reload the 
state, choose the square the ball landed on, and--oopsie-la!  "I dunno 
how I did it!"  However, Questron II limits you to 65535 gold.  Not that 
you'll need much.  Spells should cost 32000 to stock up on, so you won't 
need much more.  Repeat the Wizard's Square procedure when you get low, 
and put winnings in the bank and come back immediately.  Thankfully 
guards don't attack big winners as they did in Questron.

  QUANTUM LEAPS

    You'll generally get good by quantum leaps(not counting casino 
winnings.)

    PLEBE:  300 = max hit points, 15 agility, strength, intelligence, 
charisma, and stamina.  Studded leather and a dagger are best bets.

    Promotions
    ADVENTURER:  400 = max hit points, +5 agility, +5 strength, and now 
ring mail and a staff are sold in towns
      **You must visit Mesron by using the gold key at the hall of 
visions to get this.
    SCOUT:  500 = max hit points, +10 stamina, and you can buy a 
fauchard and bar mail
      **You must return the Wand of Power to Mesron for this.
    APPRENTICE:  600 = max hit points, +10 strength, and you can buy a 
weighted spear and chain mail.  You can also buy a trained eagle.
      **You must return the Orb to Mesron for this.
    KNIGHT:  5000 = max hit points, +5 Agility, Strength and 
Intelligence, and you can buy ribbed plate and a crossbow(although I was 
stuck with plate/shortbow)
      **You must push back Mantor at Seacrest for this.  You may need to 
do something else--make sure you visit after you've got the black key.

    Others:
    You get +5 strength at Kelfor if you manage to speak to the king.
    You can get +10 charisma in Redstone and may be able to do it twice 
once you're a knight.  I didn't check.
    You also get +5 intelligence for winning at Seacrest--talk twice to 
Mesron for the big improvement.
    

I HATE VIOLENCE!  (A GUIDE TO COMBAT)

    Dungeon combat is more forgiving than Questron, but castle and tomb 
combat are grueling.  For the dungeons, stock up on Sonic Whine and you 
should be fine.  You'll probably be more concerned with (X)amining 
enough, so your armor doesn't get destroyed.
    What makes castle and tomb combat so nasty is the following:  if you 
are a knight's move away from a guard and you pass, he will approach the 
square diagonal to you and attack you.  Of course, you can't attack him!  
The best strategy is to try to force him into a narrow place where he'll 
have to line up with you.  When he's two squares away, sock him with a 
Time Sap, then nail him with a Fireball or Magic Missile or, if you're 
advanced in the game, fight him with a weighted spear.  Repeat this as 
necessary and only take one guard on at a time.  Above all, if you must 
flee, USE TIME SAP.  Guards can outrun you in a maze(they cut corners 
when you move) and can nail you badly as you flee.
    In overland fights, after you've won, you can (X)amine for food, and 
you may get lucky.

QUICK WALKTHROUGH SUMMARY

    Stuff like how to get through the dungeons is in the dungeon 
section.

    First, you want to go to the castle and use your gold key on the 
door to the hall of visions(the one with the freaky tiles.)  Talk to 
Mesron and you'll be improved.  The strength and agility are nice, but 
moving up to 400 hit points and getting new spells even bigger.  Don't 
forget to go to Bay View for Rope&Hooks and the best weapons and Folman 
for the best armor after each promotion.
    You'll probably want to build up spells for going down into the 
tombs.  To do this, you need to build cash flow.  To do this, stop at 
the casino and play Wizard's Squares until you've got a gob of cash.  
Put most of it in the bank(maximum 65535) and play again until you're 
flush with money.  Use the save feature liberally--this is discussed 
best in the getting better quickly section.
    Your first trip down in Riverfront Cathedral will be a quick raid.  
Take the first right, go north into the room, get the MOONSTONE, and get 
out.  For fights, you'll want to use Time Sap.  Monsters are slow to 
recover in tombs(unlike castles, where they recover in two turns) so you 
can probably knock them out in ten turns before they wake up.  If you 
want to be sure, just bring some magic missiles or, better yet, 
fireballs.  Remember these have effect from a range, although they seem 
to do more damage when you're closer.  If monsters are not blocking your 
way, you can consider a Time Sap to run away from them.
    With the medallion, visit the Holy One to get Bread of Life.
    Your second trip in Riverfront's tombs will be a little longer.  Go 
east as far as you can, then go north at the two T-intersections you 
see.  (S)peak to the man blocking your way, and giving 200 gold will 
allow you access to a new area.  Beware--there are lots of monsters past 
the guy.  Dispose of them.  After walking diagonally, go east and take 
the passage down into the room.  There's another room below that where 
you'll find Morle, who will give you the BRASS KEY.
    Now, you will be looking for a random treasure.  Go back north, go 
east and then north at the "T" where you can't go east.  Follow the 
winding path and go east at the first opportunity.  You'll reach a four-
way intersection with paths west, east, northeast, and southeast.  Going 
northeast will get you some fragrant herbs to restore hit points.  Going 
southeast will wind around a bit, and you'll receive one of two items:  
the CHALICE OF ARVIL or the WAND OF POWER.  If you have the chalice, go 
back to the Holy One, who is willing to sell you more loaves.  
Otherwise, you'll have to loot the castle first, but presenting the wand 
to Mesron(speak to him) will raise you to scout.  It's probably better 
to have the wand, but you can still rout the castle with the chalice.
    In the castle, you'll need the brass key to get where you want to.  
If you have the wand, pick up the orb on the west side.  In the formerly 
closed-off northwest, which requires the brass key, you'll find that 
looting the chests gives you, in order, an emerald key, a copper key 
which also gives you +5 strength, an iron key and a unicorn horn.  You 
can probably get rid of all these guards while looting, and if you're 
killed it's not so bad, as you'll still have the important items in your 
inventory.
    The keys are located in the following places:  the northmost chest 
behind the brass door(the one that needs the brass key), another chest 
ten paces east, a chest five paces south, and a chest three south and 
east from the original brass door.
    The next time you go in the castle, open the door in the 
southwest(iron key) to get +10 charisma for 1500 gold.
    Now you'll want to go back to Rivercrest Tomb to get the item you 
didn't the first time around.  Go all the way south, all the way east, 
all the way south, and take the second passage south and go east.  Use 
the emerald key and take the first passage south.  Going east a few 
squares, you'll see the room to the north where you'll get the other 
item.  See the Holy One or Mesron, and you're well on your way.  If you 
still haven't gotten the orb, the brass key should do the trick.  Go 
back to the Hall of Visions and (S)peak to Mesron, and POW!  You've got 
a SILVER KEY, which is not terribly useful, but you're much stronger.  
Go pick up the better items, and go to Riverfront.  Go see Morle(the guy 
who gave you the brass key) again.  He'll transport you to the Realm of 
Sorcerers.  It's cheaper than buying a boat at Bay View.  You should 
have at least 3600 gold before going to the Realm.
    The first thing to do in the Realm of Sorcerers is that you can buy 
a trained eagle in Grissold, to the southeast of Demph, where you start 
out.  You'll no longer be subject to attacks this way.  Then there's the 
dungeon in the northeast.  It's not so bad, really.
    The scroll of Scalna is on level 3, and it's not hard to look 
around.  Monsters and traps are much less dense than in Questron.  Once 
you have the SCROLL OF SCALNA, you'll have an auto-map feature, which is 
very handy.  On the sixth level, you'll find an AGATE KEY, needed in the 
fortress of Kelfor, and the eighth yields the ONYX KEY which you need to 
get in the tomb at the twilight cathedral.
    The next thing to do is to loot Castle Kelfor.  The first item to 
find is the SAPPHIRE KEY, which opens the doors just north of the 
entrance, behind which you can find the RUBY KEY.  To visit the king, 
use the agate key and then the ruby key on the successive doors.  Of 
course, you'll need to go outside first before he's willing to listen to 
you.  He'll also give you an OPAL KEY which replaces the other two.  Go 
south, west and tail along the passage to use the opal key and get the 
ETERNAL FLAME.  You're now ready for the second tombs, which zigzag much 
more than the first.
    The sapphire key is, if you go to the west side of the castle and 
look for an opening, the second chest north of that opening on the west 
side.  The ruby key is in the northeastern chest of the lower door that 
the sapphire key unlocks.
    Take the second right, then go up at the 
T(northwest/north/northeast) and then left at the next t.  Then go north 
into the room and exit to the north.  At the next intersection, go left.  
At the four-way intersection, detour south into the room to get the 
fragrant herbs, then go left until the passage winds back around and 
there is a north/west/south T.  Go west, then go west at the next 
intersection.  After you bend south, turn west at the next intersection 
and go north into the room on the resultant path.  Leave to the west and 
at the second right, go east, south and west to get to the room with the 
BLACK KEY.  From there, going back is not trivial.  Go east, north, all 
the way west, all the way north along the passage 'til you get to the 
room.  Go east to the T, then north all the way, east all the way, 
northeast and follow the winding path.  Go south at the T, then north at 
the next t and then the four-way intersection.  Go south at the next t, 
and exit the room to the south.  Go east, take the diagonal, go south at 
the T then northwest at the next.  The last T, go all the way north and 
follow the winding path.  You're done!
    Well, you may want to go back to Landor now.  Speak to Mesron, and 
he should inform you that you need to go to Seacrest.  When you get 
there, cast a Fireball spell at Mesron to get him to go away.  Seacrest 
will be normal, and Mesron will promote you to knight.  Now you need to 
go to the final dungeon.  Be sure to stock up on bread of life to the 
maximum(do it at Twilight Cathedral, where you can enter the tomb, buy 
bread, etc. rather efficiently.  You may also want to take off your 
armor for a while and let monsters bash you, as the fewer hit points you 
have left, the more bread you can buy!)
    Don't worry about looking for items.  There aren't any.  Beware that 
some coffins are traps, but the fragrant herbs still get you hit points.  
Just go down all the way until you find a way down from level eight.  
Then, you'll want to head north at the first T, north at the next, west 
at the third, then west again.  From there, there's one way to go except 
for a side passage to the south you should ignore.  When you get to the 
differently tiled room run for the book and use your own Book of Magic.  
There's a new spell--DESTRUCT--which will destroy the book.  You win!

    DUNGEONS

There's shorthand for walkthroughs below.  3W = 3 west, etc.  Although 
there are interesting sidetracks, I haven't listed them here.  This is 
just the shortest way in and out.

Although traps are listed on the map, they're not in the walkthrough.  
Remember to (X)amine every few squares and especially when you turn or 
are in a door.

      Ledger
      X = wall
      ^ = a way up
      v = a way down(NOTE--this may be a trap.  Always (X)amine to see 
if this is the case, or you may take damage.)
      T = trap(acid or spikes)
      $ = chest(gold)
      C = coffin(food or statistics)
      H = fragrant herbs(hit points)

The quickest way to get to Mantor is to go north at the first t-
intersection, north at the second, then west, then west.  Speak to the 
imprisoned Morle if you must, but follow the winding path south, west, 
north and east--don't take the detour to the south, or you'll run out of 
hit points.  You can safely ignore the wizards to get to the Book and 
destroy it with the Destruct spell.

"EH?"

  There are men in the tombs that will ask you for 500 gold and then 
vanish.
