  1. INTRODUCTION

Wizard's Crown is an early RPG by Strategic Simulations, Inc.(SSI) that 
really does a good job of having you use a bunch of different attributes for 
different players in your party of eight. That's the main focus. While 
there's a good deal of ground to explore, there's not much in the way of 
dungeons. But you still have 40+ attributes to choose from and the ability to 
choose multi-class players. The drawback is that the characters will start 
with fewer skills. This paradigm, along with different weights for different 
items, foreshadows the AD&D games SSI would later print out, but unlike the 
future games you can use a "quick combat" option.

As for the object of the game, you must venture into the ruined city south of 
Arghan and defeat Tarmon, who has terrorized your city with the help of the 
Wizard's Crown turned to an evil purpose. You'll need to find a few keys, 
walk through a few mazes and unlock some passwords. Then there's a big 
gauntlet of fights on the way back. You can continue playing afterwards, 
resetting dungeons at will for some of the more fun combats. Because there's 
a sequel, Eternal Dagger, which irons out many of WC's shortcomings, and your 
characters will need vast improvement for that.

One of the main weaknesses/annoyances of Wizard's Crown was that, like so 
many early games, you couldn't save except in specific areas. With a six-
level castle near the end, and the tough puzzles at the top of it, this made 
for nastiness and the game in retrospect feeling perhaps a bit tougher than 
it was.

Wizard's Crown has a lot of attention to character detail yet it forgot the 
town name, and the adventures are usually pretty placid. The ruins are called 
"Arghan" but we don't find out much else. And in fact, there's a lot of 
detail you don't need to pay attention to, and this FAQ attempts to establish 
what you do and what you don't, so that you can get through quickly enough. 
There should even be a cheats section.

Given how hard it is to save the game I recommend the AppleWin emulator, 
which features save states, to go with Wizard's Crown, which you can find at 
fttp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_ii/games/strategy/ssi. (Yes, it's an 
RPG, but they lumped all the SSI stuff there.) You can use the save states in 
a dungeon, and in fact it's easier to reset disks too--just "remove" a disk 
from drive 2 and copy a backup over it in Windows Explorer.

A manual for this game is accessible at http://project64.c64.org/games/m-z, 
so you can look up the non-critical details there. This FAQ intends to cover 
ways to get started, move around, improve your characters, and solve the game 
quickly.

  2. CONTROLS

First, if you don't save frequently then I am afraid your most frequently 
asked question will be "why god why." Remember to (T)ell the Minstrel of Your 
Deeds frequently after fights. As you continue in the game you'll start to 
feel more powerful and it can go to your head even after you forget to save. 
Morale loss can bog your party down and result in morale loss for YOU.

    2-1. GETTING AROUND TOWN

For moving around, the game uses an odd numpad which, sadly, is not at all 
like the numpad currently used on Windows machines. It works as follows:

812
7 3
654

By the time you get used to it the game will probably be over. Still I always 
considered 1 as north and worked from there.

You will want to (S)earch when you are over something that doesn't look like 
streets. The buildings are pretty clearly marked in orange. You can (M)ake 
camp or inspect characters anywhere.

    2-2. GETTING AROUND DUNGEONS

Dungeons are a bit tougher--Lord knows why they had such a complex system for 
moving around. You will just want your Thief active(or someone with mage 
skills, so he can cast unlock) for 99% of the time. He can move around, open 
doors, and such. (S)pell casting allows you to see better, and you can 
(E)xamine things or (O)pen chests. Dungeons have the same 1-8 movements as 
towns but you also have a direction you are facing. It can be changed by 
flipping the arrows(left=counterclockwise, right=clockwise.)

Fortunately there are ways to make things easier. If you want to search along 
a south wall/bookcase you can type 25E repeatedly--or 85E if you are going 
from east to west. You can create similar move combos for a north or west or 
east walls. Also if you are next to something but not facing it you can back 
up and return.

One thing you need to consider is that if you have a thief using lockpicks 
and a combat you know about ahead, have the thief re-ready the weapon.

Diagonal movement tends to leave you facing 45 degrees clockwise of how you 
moved.

Other dungeon strategies/notes:
--Even if you mess up, you can reset a dungeon level. In fact, resetting a 
level with good treasure is a minor cheat.
--Watch what options appear/vanish while you move around in a dungeon. It can 
be a clue for what to do. For instance, in an invisible maze you still have 
directions you can go highlighted.
--use a sorcerer to open doors and a thief to examine stuff. This gets around 
futzing with lockpicks.
--Mapping is not terribly tough. If there is a spot you cannot seem to map, 
try to walk on(use the 12345678 movement square) or examine the walls around 
it.
--When looking for items, you should be aware that many chests, when opened, 
will leave seemingly useless stuff(moth-eaten clothes)--this is just part of 
the detail the authors try to add to the game.
--For dungeons in general I recommend not having any party member following 
the leader unless you are about to prepare for combat. It's just too 
cumbersome, and you can flee easily enough in combat. However, changing the 
leader is often a good idea if your leader is low on power(you need to open 
stubborn doors somehow!)  Remember that you cannot save the game in dungeons. 
If playing from the original disk, be sure to exit immediately when you find 
an important item, because if you die, you'll have to re-set and re-solve the 
dungeon. However, with emulators you can just save states.

    2-3. LOOTING

Looting is pretty straightforward. You can have a maximum of 2 large 
items(armor,) 5 large+medium items(armor and weapons) and 10 items all told. 
Early on you will want to sell whatever you can get. There's a paradox here 
in that you have to wait until night for a fight, but you have to wait until 
morning to sell what you win in a fight.

Basically if you find a magic weapon it should replace anything non-magic. 
Even bad armor is better than a good weapon, even a +1 weapon. And if you 
find any sort of jewels, take them, so you can sell it. That gets the most 
points.

You may wish to rest before haggling at the market, because morale loss 
affects haggling as a skill.

Remember that you can always have one piece of armor, and though scale 
protects more it is chain that is most valuable. Don't worry about what exact 
item values might be, but good swords and heavy crossbows tend to fetch the 
most of non-magic items. Still, the thing that's most valuable is armor. 
You'll start out just finding Cuirboilli but Veteran Scouts/Guards have Plate 
Mail and you'll also turn up random magic armor later too.

The main thing to remember about looting is that you shouldn't worry about 
perfect optimization; given the character-building part is about taking 3-4 
fights and returning, pretty much take what's there and return. Some days 
you'll get goblins with Cuirboilli, other days you'll get brigands and 
scouts. Just sell everything off and go back. Also don't neglect morale loss 
and its effect on how much you make. It'll also affect what you can search 
for.

Some small items aren't worth taking but you might as well load up on 
lockpicks and cloaks and, if you can find them, magic daggers. Of course 
jewels are small too! Stuff like shields isn't worth picking up unless it's 
the last fight before you leave.

    2-4. COMBAT

The first thing to remember about combat is that magic is set by default. 
"Magic Yes" means your party is set to use magic. It does not mean that if 
you push M, you will toggle to magic. This got me confused for a while.

Most of the time quick combat should work OK. The one thing to note in big-
picture quick combat is that if you are trying to get back to the city and 
are low on karma, either 1)locate a temple(use zigzagging as above) or 2) 
make sure you get into very easy fights where you don't use karma. Sometimes 
it might not be worth saving after WINNING a fight. Fights tend to thin out 
the more you win them in an area. But if you get stuck in the ruins after 
dark, then there will be a lot of fights.

For quick combat in dungeons, you'll want to make sure that, before a fight, 
your party is pretty close together. Otherwise your lead guy will get 
ambushed easily and it will be 7-on-the-rest instead of 8. This is especially 
useful when you have a bunch of enemies who can cast spells, or if your party 
is waiting behind a bottleneck. It's one of the many differences between easy 
and hard fights. This happens even in quick combat; the computer sort of 
plays it "in its head."

In quick or tactical combat, the computer really doesn't seem to be very 
smart or know who to hit. If you are having trouble with monsters then quick 
combat should take care of them. You will have the benefit of knowing which 
monsters are vulnerable to what(especially useful for Ward Pact Demons,) and 
you can focus there. You'll also have more autonomy over spells and can pick 
off enemy spellcasters more apparently; quick combat is just melee.

If you are fighting in a dungeon then you can position a party strategically 
before opening a door you know has monsters behind it--even beyond lumping 
other people together. Have your spellcasters and bowmen in the back; this is 
pretty self explanatory, but it's worth refreshing.

Note that you can change weapons in battle, which is handy if your thief just 
opened a door to an encounter with lockpicks he'd readied, and for the final 
fight with Tarmon it's critical. While it is definitely possible to beat 
Tarmon just readying sharp weapons before quick combat, tactical/detailed 
combat allows you to switch from them.

    2-5. HEALING AFTER COMBAT

One thing you should check for is if you have anyone poisoned. If you try to 
leave, that person may be wiped out after a warning--you'll get the warning 
and he'll be gone, that is. But generally you can avoid healing light wounds 
under 1/4 your life force or so. If you've got serious wounds, cure them 
right away, and that goes double for serious bleeding. Don't restore life 
force unless you're below 3/4 of your regular total. It's important to keep 
healthy, but localized perfectionism may come back to trap you later.

Note that if you do pray mistakenly, you might as well heal someone--a Raise 
Dead, for instance, will cure all life force. The only thing it doesn't seem 
to do is cure poison! If you were poisoned and killed, you're poisoned on 
resurrection.

normal bleeding: 4
normal injuries: 8
serious bleeding: 15
serious injuries: 20
restore life force: 30
raise dead: 45

Also you'll want to have high first aid early because mistreated normal 
injuries turn serious, requiring more karma. But if you've got 200 First Aid 
the amount you save in karma will be worth it.

  3. CREATING A PARTY

    3-1. STARTING OUT

I recommend looting the current party and setting up a group that works as 
follows:

3 Fighter-mages(16 intelligence) use sword, spear, mace
3 Fighter-clerics(12) use sword, spear, mace
1 Ranger(5) uses spear
1 Fighter-thief(8) uses sword

I'm not looking at axes or flails because they take too much to build up. I 
also found a lot more magic swords/maces/spears early on compared to 
flails/axes, in part probably because there's more variety for swords et al. 
You should also consider giving someone close combat skills if you find a 
good dagger. It's best to have a 3-3-2 combination of bash-cut-thrust(2 can 
be any of these) and if you can improve skill easily, so much the better. 
Most of your damage will be from the magic side of your weapons by the time 
you finish anyway, so paying more to get slightly more physical damage just 
isn't worth it.

Give everyone 16 strength(for plate mail) and spend the rest on dexterity. I 
never had a problem going through the game with 25 life and the main way to 
winning is being able to strike early.

You may wish to drop a fighter-mage for a fighter, or you may wish to change 
to a fighter-priest. The big problem with fighter-mages is that they have no 
dexterity to start. While a fighter-thief-mage could do it all in dungeons it 
wouldn't be very useful early. But you might be able to use just a plain 
fighter.

This won't be great for your strength early on, but you can improve everyone 
quickly. I suggest giving everyone 50 life and 16 strength and giving the 
rest to dexterity. Note that once you've gotten your character classes there 
is no need to improve intelligence further. Dexterity is the best to improve 
because it makes you attack quicker. Wizard's Crown frequently allows enemies 
critical hits for either side for dubious reasons in combat, and this takes 
advantage of things.

Remember to take the items off the original players. In fact, you could 
create gofer characters early on with 16 strength--you could take their 
armor, etc., and sell it for a while. Just be sure that you get rid of 
people's gold before you ditch them! It's maybe not a foolproof way to do 
things, and your main expense down the road will be 50 GP to build up magic 
items, so you need several trips to get started, but it is not a bad idea to 
get started.

      3-1-1. EARLY EASY MONEY CHEAT

About taking items off original players--it's also possible to make lots of 
money off them early. It won't do you much good early on, but you can save 
the cash for when you start getting magic weapons and armor, and that will 
help you.

So here's what to do:

1. create a thief. Give him all the experience you can. Don't worry about 
anything else.
2. use the experience for haggling.
3. create a bunch of guys and have them fill up all slots in the inn with 
brigandine and greatswords. Yes...later on you can just reach in and grab 
some when you need a bit of extra cash for that +1 boost.
4. sell off any items your other players have remaining. You'll get a good 
deal, since the thief will have 120 experience. Assuming he starts at 10, 
3*(90/4.5)=60 experience will get him to 100. Another 60 should get him to 
20*(4+1/2)=50. So you will start with 150 haggling, which is pretty good. You 
will want to create fighters with greatswords. Those get the most money, 
along with brigandine(shields+1-handed weapons don't really match up.) Each 
player gets 2000 gold for what he sells, so if you work about 15 times(not 
too hard) you will get a whopping 210 gold. That's really a lot, because it 
can improve +1 plate to +5, or a magic weapon to storm.
5. Yeah, the party you cheat with stinks, so be sure to save after each run, 
and be sure your frontloader has all the money before removing the other 
guys. Remember the limit on gold(250) too, so you can only do so much of 
this.

    3-2. WHAT TO IMPROVE, WHEN

In the long term you can improve anything, but I wrote this FAQ so that 
winning the game wouldn't be long-term. So what's most effective soonest?

      3-2-1. SKILLS

Some skills, only one person needs to improve. Others, you all will. Some are 
just useless. Also it's too hard to be a jack-of-all-trades so don't try to 
wrench your characters into that. Also, don't worry if you're not improving 
fast enough. The game has no time limits. Remember too that morale loss 
affects all but karma, turn undead, luck and spell power.

Skills(besides karma--1XP/point and power--3XP/point) improve as follows: for 
1-100, you get a random boost of 1-8. 101-150, 1-4. 151-200, 1-2. 201-250, 1. 
Beware that if you improve something at 250, the computer will suck the 
experience will disappear. The following skills need 3 XP for improvement:

Close combat, mace, crossbow, combat awareness
Swimming, hunt, first aid, haggling, evaluate magic

4 XP:
sword, spear, shield, scan, track, picklock, treat poison, treat disease, 
turn undead, read ancient

5 XP: bow, stealth, disarm trap, alchemy

6 XP: axe, flail, luck, cast spell

WEAPON SKILLS, COMBAT AWARENESS, SCAN
I generally try to go with 2-handed weapons for maximum damage. So shield 
isn't valuable. I also don't care about intangible skills. I doubt they 
programmed too much into the game about using them in quick combat anyway. My 
recommendation is to increase your initial weapon's skill to 100. Wait until 
you start getting "real" magic items(not +1/+5 but magic or doom) and then 
distribute items according to who gets them. If you get a very good magic 
item it's worthwhile to give up on any character improvement to switch over. 
You can get back up to 100 easily enough.)

SHIELD
I didn't really worry about this. Even if you can use the shield for offense 
as well as defense, they break against axes, so you can get a nice fancy 
shield and it breaks and why bother?

SWIMMING
Kind of useful in one dungeon if everybody is moving around, which won't be 
the case if you want to stay sane.

STEALTH
You should be able to beat up every enemy, so no need to hide.

HUNT
Not used here. See Eternal Dagger.

TRACK
Also not used here.

FIRST AID
Very useful, but only your ranger, who probably has nothing else to improve, 
really needs it. He needs bandages, which appear randomly after fights and 
get used up. You can't buy them at an armory. Just pick them up when you can.

SEARCH
Good search helps you find secret doors easier. It's hard to tell what a good 
minimum is to get through the game. But a high search apparently lets you 
find more loot after beating monsters. Very highly recommended, after 
haggling.

DISARM TRAP
You should be able to withstand most traps, so don't worry about this. Since 
"traps" is barely plural in this game, anyway.

PICKLOCK
Somewhat useful early so you don't have to be casting spells. But eventually 
you'll have great spellcasters and this won't matter.

HAGGLE
Very very very useful. Have your thief maximize this before all others.

TREAT POISON
Critical because characters can die and get rubbed out by its effects, even 
after an otherwise easy win. Improve this as quickly as you can. In fact it's 
worth improving for one of your priests at the temporary expense of karma 
until it gets to 100! 100 should be enough to cure most anything at first, 
but morale loss will drag it down. This is the ultimate insurance policy.

TREAT DISEASE
Diseased players don't regain morale with rest. This isn't used at all in WC.

TURN UNDEAD
Very useful for your clerics, but not the main stat.

ALCHEMY
I found this useless.

LUCK
Prevents magic damage, so I think it's worth it. Note that it and turn undead 
are bounded in practice by karma.

READ ANCIENT
One person needs this skill, and not much of it(to 100?)

EVALUATE MAGIC
The better this is for one player, the more magic items you will 
find/understand. Therefore it's in your interest to get someone to max this 
out, but only one person.

CAST SPELL
Affects if you cast a spell successfully. Very important for mages.

One character(fighter-thief-spells) will want to improve haggling 
immediately. You always get the benefit of the best haggler in your party, 
and the gold you get is worth it. Don't worry about anything else until your 
thief gets rather good at it. Because once you have haggling, you'll have to 
work a lot less to make money by looting and such. It'll take a while to get 
into dungeons, so stuff like search and picklock, while important, can wait.

Eventually you'll want to improve your life force once the dexterity gets off 
the charts, but for now it's a good idea to concentrate on the fighter-
clerics building up karma.

Here's a chart of what to improve:

F-S 1: evaluate magic to 200, then see F-S 2/3
F-S 2/3: weapon to 100, cast spell to 100, power to 100
   Then go to 200, then 250
F-P 1: cure poison to 100, then see F-P 2/3
F-P 2/3: karma to 100, weapon to 100, karma to 250,
   Turn Undead to 150, Luck to 150, then 200's, then weapon to 250
   Don't put undead/luck to 250 as your karma won't stay there for long.
R: weapon to 100, first aid to 100, then 150 for both, 200, 250
   Improve dexterity after that, then life when dexterity hits 30
F-T: haggle to 200, search to 150, haggle to 250, search to 250
   Whenever you get a magic item, get that to 100. With thief skills
   maximized, improve weapon skills.

When you've got nothing left to do, improve dexterity.

      3-2-2. ITEMS

There are several places where you can improve items for 50 gold--in the NE 
of the inside wall and beyond the ruins at the bottom(password: "breakfast.") 
That figure sounds like a lot, but if you poke around in the ruins you can 
find what you need. Magic bonuses range from 1 to 5. While you can have many 
items with skill bonuses, we are only focusing on items you can improve here. 
The most important items to improve are weapons.

Basically there are three types of magic weapons. If an item doesn't start 
out as magical, you can't make it. The first type is the straight-plus 
weapon. For each extra plus, you get an extra 3 points of magic damage. But 
it pales in comparison to the other types.

The second type is the elemental. The progression here is:
Magic     = 10 magic damage
Frost     = 20
Flaming   = 30
Lightning = 40
Storm     = 50

Then there are life drain items.
Dark  = 12
Doom  = 25
Soul  = 38
Demon = 50
Death = 60

Obviously the life drain items are a bit better bargain, but whatever you can 
find, improve. It's worthwhile enough to get an item that doesn't do the most 
physical damage, either. You can't control when you find magic items. Just 
take what you can get, and if something better comes along later, accept the 
luck of the draw.

Protection is CUMULATIVE(unlike Eternal Dagger,) so if you have nothing else 
to spend your gold on, start improving your rings. Then stuff like armor--it 
doesn't strictly matter which goes first, but if you wait you're more likely 
to find magic plate mail, which is the best. You may occasionally find a rare 
Dwarven, Elven or Reenforcing item. These are always good and equate to 
something roughly +4.

Note there's a small benefit to improving +3/+4 to +4/+5 over +1/+2 to +2/+3. 
Also I find that I like to improve my very best items as I'm much more likely 
to find a lower-charged item which could replace what I improved anyway. I 
generally allot 2 small spots for my items--any more and it gets in the way 
of treasure.

Protection by type
          B  C  T PM  M 
Wizard's 10 10 10 10 10
      +1  2  2  2  2  1
      +2  4  4  4  4  2
      +3  6  6  6  6  3
      +4  8  8  8  8  5
      +5 10 10 10 10  7
Dwarven   5 20  5  5  3
Elven     5  5 20  5  3
Reenforc 20  5  5  5  3

Note that if you can't find magic plate mail, magic scale and chain will do. 
There's not much difference at the +5 level. Don't spend too much time 
waiting for the perfect items; in fact if you find +5 chain then you will 
probably just want to have someone wear that and improve other items rather 
than sell that and wait for +5 plate.

I find +1 jars to be better protection than shields, if you wind up finding 
1-handed weapons early on, and you'll probably find a random +3 one opr 
dwarven/elven/reenforcing eventually. But don't waste time improving it and 
don't wait for 1-handed weapons at the expense of 2-handed. Take whatever 
comes.

I would like to note that Lordbub mentioned in a topic that +5 stuff is 
better than a +5 shield. A magic item defends you from 10 bash and other 
stuff. A shield just defends vs bash.

    3-3. IMPROVING

There are many ways to get better in Wizard's Crown for the two goals to 
achieve: great stats and great items. You'll find potentially great items 
throughout the game. Great stats come with the territory.

At first you won't be able to go into the ruins much and you'll need to beat 
up folks in-town. Once town is cleared out there are slim pickings. You can 
run the road north of the town and continually sell the goodies you find. But 
you may have to wait for your first break--a magic weapon. It'll probably 
take a while, by which time you can make it a Death or Storm weapon off the 
bat. Try to give it to a high-dexterity guy. Then protect him as much as 
possible. Whatever magic necklaces, armor, etc., you have, throw it on him. 
Let your fighter-sorcerers languish until everyone else has got something.

Remember that you can pick up scale/chain armor in the ruins as well. You 
start with brigantine and finding these is cheaper than getting plate. In 
fact since plate costs a bit of money you may never want to buy it from the 
armory. +1 scale is better than plate anyway, and something like that will 
eventually turn up. Don't waste the money.

Meanwhile your priests will be improving their turn undead, etc. This makes 
many parts of the ruins easier; you can beat up undeads pretty quickly. Also, 
once you get a few magic items you can afford to stay out at night in the top 
parts. You'll mostly fight wolves and large spiders in the grass, but if you 
keep to the roads you can beat up some brigands for nice treasure. The 
pickings aren't great, though. If you are really lost for what to do you can 
reset the Rusty Nail a few times, but that will probably get old. You can 
also sell the Emerald Key for a quick boost for an item, but be sure to have 
rope handy.

Eventually you'll need to go into the ruins. The rule of thumb here is: win 3 
fights, then retreat--this gives you an added 10-experience bonus when you 
get back to the inn, and it prevents you from having to leave behind too much 
good treasure. Learn who's tough and who's not. Enemies generally come in 
recognizable lumps. Use magic whenever you need to and avoid it on weaker 
opponents. Watch your morale loss; when you get below 30(for starters) you 
want to go to the taverns. Make sure your money is spread around--10 copper 
cures one morale loss point--and then if you want to get back to playing 
right away, rest in the inn.

Often it will be immediately profitable just to visit a tavern before selling 
stuff off, because your haggling is affected by morale loss. Also, there's no 
reason to delay doing stuff. While I've won the game in 100 days(most of that 
due to improving items at the magic user's) there's no limit, and really 
trying to save a few game-days will lose you a few real-life-hours.


Note that you may want to have fine/sharp weapons at the inn for the final 
fight with Tarmon. When you find one that is particularly good, don't sell 
it. Of course, you'll want to make sure there is one item for each of your 
players depending on his weapon skill. Remember that you'll find a very sharp 
spear at Tarmon's, and

fine<very fine<sharp<very sharp

Also these items can give you extra skills or even cast spells, and they are 
OK to hit Tarmon with, too.

Once you get pretty good(i.e. able to beat ogres,) head SW in the ruins near 
the temple. You can actually wait 'til it's dark or go in the temple until 
it's dark. Then run around. The grassy areas hide undeads, who leave behind 
good treasure. You'll pick up magic items quickly. Praying at the temples 
gets you back to 1/2 maximum karma. Eventually you'll have had it, and fights 
that should be easy will give you trouble--it's tough to know when in the 
night it is, but you may need to rest up in the temple a bit for it to be 
day. Then go back NE to the town and sell everything you won.

Later on you can do this with temples further down, but even when I was 
pretty good I used this fishing hole all the time. Speaking of fishing holes 
there are a lot of other good places to look when you're good enough. You may 
get dud fights everywhere, but trolls and dragons SE/S give great treasure, 
and gargoyles below Gozaroth's are great too. You get brigands and scouts in 
the east grass by the ruins, but veteran adventurers and guards to the south 
are noxious. The grass on the west side affords some tough fights, too. If 
you're really good I bet you can beat up dragons during the dark.

Of course there are monsters to avoid. Any area with golems should be 
avoided. SE/S has some grassy areas with Gnarled Trees which are tough and 
give litle treasure. What's worse, they shred your morale because the fight 
takes so long.

But of course you can just go explore further randomly once one place starts 
losing enemies and you should do OK. 3 fights and back and you'll build up 
experience quickly enough. Don't worry too much about just missing out on 
improving an item(i.e. you have 43 gold.) It may seem as though your party's 
improvement is flatlining for a while, but once you go to a tavern you'll 
find they're much improved the next time you go out, with the effects of your 
latest improvements.

Always remember, too, to go through every looting you can. And remember that 
when your weapon skills get to 200+ you can even risk 100 morale loss--at 
least in the first sector at nighttime--to improve. I've found a lot of good 
stuff there, and you don't have to wait for agreeable fights. There's simply 
no reason to go deep into the ruins until you want to see if you're good 
enough. Plus, when you're very good, you won't lose morale at the easy fights 
with the undead--and with a 250 search, jewels frequently turn up for you.

The first items to improve are weapons since they can inflict whopping damage 
at their best. For armor you may want to wait and use whatever's magic for a 
while. I'm of the opinion +5 leather is better than +1 plate because it gives 
more protection overall and you can just use an extra protective cloak or 
ring or whatever. The loss in natural bash/cut/thrust protection is 
negligible compared to the magic bonus you get and the time you save not 
having to improve the plate.

Anyway, you should also improve any +1 jars or whatever that you find once 
you have a strong magic 1-handed weapon. I think I already mentioned that you 
should take 1-handed or 2-handed weapons as they come, but I find shields 
really useless. For the tougher fights you need magic protection. And of 
course you want to protect your fastest guys, and guys with the best weapons, 
first. But once you get a new item, let the wealth trickle down.

Dwarven/Elven/Reenforcing items are always worth keeping and using as they 
are roughly +4.

To approach Tarmon's Castle you'll probably want Storm/Death weapons for 
everyone, +5 of your armor, and a +5 accessory--Dwarven etc. can substitute 
for this. You can also have accessories with a combined +5 total.

One other very lucrative place to look(thanks to Popcorn Demon in the 
Wizard's Crown/Apple topic) is the 1-square green patch in the center-left 
sector. White Rabbits give a lot of treasure, and they're only on that 
square, but they're rather tough! Maybe you can fight them at night.

Also, if you are having trouble with golems in certain fights, you can get a 
few golem staffs by resetting Gozaroth's and just bash away.

  4. WALKTHROUGH

See "3-3. IMPROVING" for ways to get better if you find one area too tough. 
You may have to go back to it several times through the course of the game.

    4-1. IN TOWN

The town isn't very big--about 20x20 on a grid with the rest of the 30x30 
being grassland beyond the borders. Gates lock at sundown and open at dawn. 
Thugs roam. You can't see monsters--they pop up randomly. Save early after 
every fight. But first, make sure everyone's readied everything. You'll 
probably just want to run around town for a while, although you can run 
quicky outside and back for fun. Remember to SEARCH when you seem to come 
across an interesting place. Otherwise, you won't be able to enter any 
buildings. Note also when your location description changes(i.e. "City" to 
"Poor area" or "Marketplace" it is a good idea to search. Note that staying 
at a tavern decreases your morale. In the west end there'll be a bunch of 
thugs accosting a girl. Fight them and she'll tell you about her father in 
the NE of the fields north of the town. He'll have a nice reward for you. 
It's a +2 broadsword, and you may have to save before exiting the town, but 
you're likely not to get attacked. Accept his gift, and you've suddenly got 
the ability to do magic damage. Plus, if you find a +1 bottle or something, 
your player can ready that for extra protection.

Fights are plentiful at night, and there's always a temple nearby where you 
can pray and restore karma to heal everyone. Still as you are developing you 
will want to improve your priests' karma until they can all raise the 
dead(they'll get killed too!) though you'll need one to learn cure poison as 
well. Your thief's haggling will rise. Then you can start really chipping 
away.

You can probably clear the town your first night if you start with dexterous 
players. The trick is just to spend whatever experience you can on karma on 
returning to the inn after each fight and re-visiting the temples. Just keep 
running around in a square. You really don't have that much else to do. You 
may become overloaded with items to sell, but that's ok. In the morning if 
you visit the inner circle you should get congratulations and two gold pieces 
per player. This is a nice boost.

The marketplace is the big white square in the north. Look around it. Search 
anywhere and you can sell items.

      4-1-1. THE INNER SQUARE

You can only visit this in the daytime. You can buy from the armory in the 
inner circle--it's the SW building. Then east is the money changer--you'll be 
visiting frequently. That big 2x2 building is training--which seems cool, and 
it's a way to spend your money, but I prefer to build up experience and get 
more money I can spend on items. You can improve up to 100, and the formula 
is (points to improve) * (current skill level) gets you another point nd 
takes an hour.

There's a park in the SE where an old man tells stories(see the end of the 
guide.) In the NE corner is an unmarked magic shop where, for 50 gold, you 
can get an item enchanted. It'll be handy later. Note you may want to visit 
the money changer if you have the equivalent of 50 gold, but not quite 50 
gold. You may have to camp, pool your money to someone, and have them 
exchange. The money changer is also handy because if you have more than 255 
gold pieces for any one person, you only replace smaller coins with higher 
value ones. So it saves you cash in the long run. Remember:

Copper, Silver, Electrum, Gold = 1, 10, 100, 1000

You can also buy weapons from the armory(on the west) although that is a bit 
useless. It does however tell you which items are best to loot. You can 
overhear gossip in the market area as well in the center(orange dots in 
white,) but there's nothing terribly consequential there.

    4-2. NORTH OF TOWN

There's not much here that's really worthwhile. Don't attack the merchants on 
the road as you'll get burned on prices back in town. In the NE corner is a 
man who will give you a +2 Broadsword if you rescued his daughter. You won't 
use it forever, but it's a great start. Sadly many of the combats here aren't 
treasure-intensive but they can build you up some more. If it gets to be 
evening, don't get shut out unless you're really looking for experience and 
are pretty good, but not good enough for that next part of the ruins. There's 
no temple where you can pass the time to get back in. The tavern gives good 
advice, but save before entering it. Because you will be stuck there 
overnight. It's possible to just search around a bunch. The NW area has an 
alchemist's, but that's for stuff you use in tactical combat.

    4-3. THE RUSTY NAIL(THIEVES' GUILD)

This is in the middle of the poor area of the city, on the east side. It'll 
look like a tavern, and the game will ask "Do you want to enter the Rusty 
Nail?" There's really not a lot to do here although you can buy some magic 
stuff and even visit the master thief. At first, you'll want to face him 
alone. Set one party member to active and have the rest be independent. He'll 
tell you where the old thieves' guild is(14 east of the entry to the ruins. 
It's marked distinctively--looks like the thieves' guild--in case you 
forget.)

The way to the master is to examine the sole pickle barrel. Only bring one 
player, your thief--otherwise he will attack. Later on you may wish to beat 
him in a fight. That will get you a lot of treasure. You'll probably want to 
wait until you've cleared the city. But once you do, you can reset the 
dungeon to your heart's content.

If you try to search for the treasure with the master still around, he'll 
attack you, but it should be pretty clear where it is. Search the top of the 
bookcase in the room behind the barrel, then search 4W of the stairs up(which 
lead back to the surface too.) The chest west of the master has a lot of 
silver, and the one behind the secret doors has a cloak useful for stealth, 
and you can sell it for gold, too.

For fun you can talk to the patrons of the Rusty Nail. You can also fight 
them before opening any doors, and you can fight the master and his two 
assassins later. You can fight these groups together if you wish, but if your 
party is too disjointed (i.e. you had one guy go on a solo trip and crowded 
everyone else into the starting corner) then you will really suffer. You can 
start a fight by stepping on a table or pushing "F" while facing someone.

You can keep resetting to get treasure here.

    4-4. THE RUINS

The ruins consist of six blocks of 30x30 areas. When you get to the edge of 
one you can't see what's below there. The wizard's spell stops you from going 
any further. Also, many buildings are dilapidated and offer nothing. Here's 
what each division holds:

Up-left: reentry to town in NE, temple in SW
Up-right: old thieves' guild in NW, temple in SW
Center-left: Gozaroth in the east
Center-right: nothing
Down-left: temple in center and portal("breakfast") to magic shops below. 
Going around the wall leads to some very nasty monsters indeed.
Down-right: Tarmon's inside a big structure. You need the emerald key and the 
password.

Generally, the farther south you go in the ruins, the tougher combats are. 
Especially tough are the combats in the far south grassy area--excellent 
places to build up a party for the final combat, which is in the SE. You can 
also work down the right side. The game seems to know when you've cleared an 
area, too. Temples are scattered around. The word "SHALPA" will allow you to 
enter and restore karma/rest, but only to half of your maximum karma. And 
only the inn will restore magic power.

Still you'll find pockets with good fights, and at night you can really whip 
up on enemies.

      4-4-1. OLD THIEVES' GUILD

Bring along 100' of rope to get here. If you don't have it, get in random 
fights until you do find it. This is not a very tough dungeon, and there's 
not a lot to do. But you can still go through the paces. You just need 
someone with decent swimming--it should be enough to make sure nobody's lost 
any morale.

        4-4-1-1. LEVEL 1

There is nothing special on the first level apart from the well you need to 
descend to get to the second. At the top, examine the fireplace to the south. 
When prompted if you want to use 50' of rope, say yes. You may have a fight 
with zombies along the way.

        4-4-1-2. LEVEL 2

On the second level there are important clues and a very important item. The 
entrance to the prison is in the NW. Following east in the third cell, 
there's a clue, and in the fifth, there's an emerald key, which is critical 
for getting certain places. You also find the location of Gozaroth's Mansion. 
There's some assorted treasure as well.

The southwest has a couple of secret doors. 3E of the desk, you find 
something, then 1N1W of the NE corner is another secret door. The treasure's 
not much(cuirboilli) but the whole process should reenforce that you need to 
be aggressive about areas you haven't looked at yet--just search everywhere 
around them.

To get out of this mess, note the way up is back where you started. There's a 
river heading into a wall and 1W2N of that are stairs up. "Next" to the 
appropriate player and step on that square, and everyone will climb.

Don't let the emerald key go. It unlocks several places. While you can sell 
it for a nice amount of money, it's more hassle to get it back than a 
fight(which can net 10 gold.)

      4-4-2. GOZAROTH'S MANSION

Gozaroth's is in the west central sector of the ruins, due south of the gate 
to the city. Be sure to have the emerald key or you won't be able to get 
anywhere. You'll see an unusually tidy 5x5 block with a wall completely 
intact--that's it. Gozaroth's is not particularly combat-intensive and your 
object is twofold: get the golem staff and find the password from Gozaroth. 
There's some nice side treasure too, though.

        4-4-2-1. LEVEL 1

Have your leader ready the emerald key. Go straight east. South of the stairs 
is a room with two pickle barrels. The north one holds the first third of the 
staff. There's not much else here but if you search a fireplace along the 
south wall you'll fight a large spider.

        4-4-2-2. LEVEL 2

"Don't let maids clean up the school room!"  The school room is in the north 
center. Search the fireplace there for the second part of the golem staff. To 
the west of it is a room with vampires. West of the center you have a bunch 
of undead fighters. Also you overhear a clue that the master's cloak is 
covered with acid. There's not much other treasure, but there are some easy 
enough fights. The stairs up are behind a door in the NW center. You may have 
to search for it?? and it is tough to lockpick.

        4-4-2-3. LEVEL 3

Search the chest full of sticks(the bottom one) two times to find the third 
part of the staff--with all three parts you can form the Golem Staff. You 
don't have to have them all in one place. A cloak you find is a trap as per 
the clue on level 2, so don't take it the first time, then take it. Gozaroth 
is waiting in the southwest. Release him from his bonds, and he tells you the 
Ward Word is ROBIN and also tells you about the Ward Pact Demons(susceptible 
to only one of BASH, CUT and THRUST damage--determined at random)  Ward Pact 
Demons are found on the first level of the castle and in the extreme SE.

      4-4-3. THE PALACE

The palace is in the southeast section of the ruins. Gozaroth gave you a 
word("ROBIN") to use at the palace gates. You'll need to use it in 
conjunction with the key, which you may need to ready. It's pretty random 
when you exit the palace--you have to run back to the city--but you'll have a 
powerful extra item to help you cope with the enemies, and your morale loss 
will be at zero. Besides, you should probably already have dealt with enemies 
at night.

Be sure to bring 150' of rope, or you'll have to backtrack when you get to 
level 6. You may have to backtrack anyway, to rest and pray. It's possible to 
use a scorched-earth policy here of just going into the castle, losing a 
fight, and repeating(fights don't reappear.) But I'll assume you can get it 
all in one go, skipping over the resting parts.

You may want to divide getting through this into two parts if you can't 
figure out the puzzle on level 4, but thankfully there's a nice stream on 
level 6 that wipes out all your lost morale.

If you've got +5 armor, a +5 accessory and +5 other-stuff, your characters 
should be built up well enough to make this doable. Also, there are fights 
here that may be tricky. You'll want to place your party well before starting 
off, or you may wind up having to run down a tunnel for them to get 
slaughtered.

        4-4-3-1. LEVEL 1

Search the room east of entry to find a map 1U1R from the NW. I'd take the 
stairs in the bottom. The room to the right has Ward Pact Demons, a good 
fight, but you can skip it if you're just trying to be all business. In the 
SE you have a salamander who tells you about the secret doors on level 2 if 
you let him go. But fighting is good for experience too.

        4-4-3-2. LEVEL 2

This is straightforward enough, but actually there's nothing in the NW even 
though it seems prudent mappers might note there's the space for a secret 
area there. Head up through the door. To the left you have rooms with some 
nice treasure, but to the right you see the other stairs(it'd have been 
crowded to walk up that way.) By the east stairs you have demons in the set 
of roms to the south and some to the north as well. But the key room is to 
the west after you go north. There's a secret door in the middle of the 
fireplace on the west side. Golems come out of the woodworks to attack. Good 
place to have a golem staff ready, although far more important is to be able 
to place your party correctly.

This means having one player as the leader and everyone following him once 
he's able to get to the doors. When he's in the golem room, bring everyone up 
so they form a phalanx they can take the golems on right away. There are 14 
of them. If you want to be really careful, you can have one player next to 
golems one and two, the next fighting two more etc., and the guy opening the 
fireplace fighting the salamander. But put the guys in another room and they 
get slaughtered one by one as they walk in the door.

Behind the fireplace you'll find the stairs to level 3. There's also 
something to read just left-of-center of the bookcase on the north wall.

        4-4-3-3. LEVEL 3

This level contains an invisible maze. You got the map on level 1 and can 
ready it with both hands to view it, but I'm including it below the paragraph 
as a spoiler. "+" indicates where it is safe to step and "x" indicates 
lightning(heavy injury but no bleeding) will strike you there. Zeros are 
inaccesible squares, and "p" indicates a pillar the computer suggests that 
you examine. It's imperative that you have one active character and no 
followers. Otherwise you can't be sure what sort of damage your followers 
will sustain.

NOTE:  The computer will indicate if there are blank squares you can't 
step on in the "12345678" by not highlighting certain directions.

There's not much else to do, really. You don't need everyone to walk up the 
stairs, which is a break.

        4-4-3-4. LEVEL 4

Level 4 has a weird doors puzzle which you don't need to do(but it helps 
avoid morale loss,) and it also has a mapping puzzle where, this time, a part 
that seems like it might be a nice secret, is. The second door to your south 
holds a crank that will open up a passage to the east. If you map out the 
rest of the area you'll find a 3x2 room below this; 1E of the SW corner, 
search south and there is a small closet full of sharp weapons. Search the 
center-south square to find a Very Sharp Spear. This will be invaluable in 
your fight against Tarmon.

There are magic doors here. The pillar on level 3 was a basic code for how to 
get certain doors to open. The code is below:

  Open Close
N ...C ....
E O... C.OC
S CO.. OO.O
W OCO. ..O.
H OOCO ....
F CC.C ....

What does this mean?  These are the combinations for being able to open/close 
a door. It says whether, respectively, the status of the North, East, South, 
and West doors required to open said door. For instance, to open the West 
door, the North and South doors must be opened, and the East door must be 
closed, and the West door's status doesn't matter. However, to close the West 
door, the South door must be open. A period means this door can be in either 
state.

H and F stand for hidden and far doors. The hidden door is three west of the 
south door. The far door is south of it. Between the H and F doors is vital 
information.

If this puzzle seems confusing, don't worry. It's not critical. Technically, 
you can just open the west door, have one player walk through the oppressive 
hallway(damaging his morale hugely), and get to level five, where you need to 
weather one fight--or lose it and restart--before getting to Tarmon.

However, you'll still need to know a WORD(see below) to get the crown itself. 
So to play the game properly you'll need to be able to open the hidden door.

Opening the west door is hard enough. The solution is below. You can always 
fumble around and backtrack to closing all doors. Just start with  is below, 
with extra carriage returns to prevent spoilers. If you get stuck, there is 
always a way out. Look for where you are in the walkthrough, or try to get 
there.

Off to the west of the clean private corridor you have a meat locker and 
below that someone who tells you Tarmon's secret weakness: nonmagic items.

        4-4-3-5. LEVEL 5

Have everyone follow your ladder, because there's a tough fight here once you 
get within a few steps of the stairs, but other than that, you just go from 
the southeast to the northwest and down to level 6. The rubble is irrelevant. 

        4-4-3-6. LEVEL 6

Tarmon taunts you again...but now that you are in the Garden of Life, why not 
drink from the stream(examine it)?  It'll heal you for the upcoming battle. 
Stand inside the contraption on the north wall and examine to the south, then 
the north. If you've got 150 feet of rope the north wall will open up and 
you'll meet Tarmon. Obviously, tell him no.

Unless you've byte-edited the disk, Tarmon will prove a tough proposition. 
You can't touch him with magic weapons or yours will disintegrate, so have 
someone attack him with a sharp weapon--or, if you are using quick combat, 
ready sharp/fine weapons beforehand and turn magic on and watch things go. 
Again, you'll want everyone to be following the leader so that when the fight 
starts you'll be able to run at the demons before they cast spells that'll 
really damage you.

Tarmon will probably be the last one to go, but positioning really does make 
the difference between a comfortable win and a total blowout loss. Once you 
get past the bad guys, refresh your characters again by drinking from the 
stream.

Examine the square a couple squares west of the table. There's a keyhole, 
where the emerald key fits. Ready your emerald key and hit O to open. You 
will be asked your name--tell them what you learned on the fourth 
floor(DORVAL) or you'll be killed. Once you get the Wizard's Crown, back-
tracking through the castle is not hard. Beware, however, that on the first 
floor you will be attacked by demons that break from statues in the palace's 
entry room. It's not a very tough fight--24 hell born--but it can be a nasty 
surprise.

    4-5. THE WAY BACK

There'll be a lot more monsters fighting you on the way back. If you win a 
fight with major damage you may not want to save. In fact, early on you may 
have high-morale-loss fights and you may just want to save if you move one 
square safely. If it's nighttime, you'll want to get to a temple so that you 
aren't shut out when you get to the town gates. So head in an UL direction 
for the temple--northwest to the little orange loop, then north. If you are 
really suffering, or you really want to play it safe you can go west once you 
leave the gate. Then in the patch white area go NW into the temple. Remember 
you walk the same number of squares going NW-NE as N-N. You may want to 
consider saving after walking a few squares if you are really hurting. In 
that case you may just go NE a few squares before going back NW and touching 
the small loop mentioned above.

At the temple to the north, rest until dawn and then the final trek NE should 
not trouble you. At the gates you'll be greeted and given a bonus, and you'll 
even get to keep the Wizard's Crown!

Once you get in the city with the crown, there's a two-page blurb 
acknowledging your achievements and a side note saying you may be able to 
import your characters into a planned sequel--that sequel happens to be 
called "Eternal Dagger."  In the meantime, you can loot the ruins if you feel 
like it. You can even win the game again or see how long you last in the 
grass below the palace.

Your extra bonus is +6 strength, +30 life, +6 dexterity(to a maximum of 30) 
and no experience, but if you go to the inn you'll get +10. Oh and you get to 
keep the crown for further looting.

  5. MONSTER PROPERTIES

  I listed some basic monster properties below. Note some monsters have the 
same names but different attributes. They also leave different items in 
combat.

  7. GAME SCRIPTS

  There are several interesting game scripts in Wizard's Crown. They include 
the old man in the park in the inner square who tells you about Bealar and 
Deld. There is also some tavern talk. These are listed below. The old man in 
the park has useful tips in each story. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 are the most 
useful.

    7-1. THE OLD MAN IN THE PARK

YOU SEE AN OLD MAN, HE LOOKS UP AT YOU AND ASKS IF YOU WISH TO HEAR A 
STORY. (S)TAY OR (L)EAVE
If you choose to stay:

(This is always the introduction)
HE THEN BEGINS A LONG STORY ABOUT "TWO SWORD" BEALAR IN ARGHAN ...THE 
STORY IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND PART OF IT SOUNDS USEFUL...

I believe these rotate from day to day.
1. BEALAR SOON REGRETTED HIS ROBBING OF A MERCHANT. WHEN HE TRIED TO 
SELL THE GOODS HE WAS NEVER OFFERED MORE THAN HALF THEIR MARKET VALUE
2. BEALAR BARELY ESCAPED THE CLUTCHES OF THE NECROMANCER BY UTTERING THE 
WORD "SHALPA" AND ENTERING THE TEMPLE'S ENCHANTED DOOR
3. BEALAR DECIDED IT WOULD BE SAFER TO GET THE REWARD FOR CLEANING UP 
THE TOWN THAN LOOTING THE RUINED CITY ARGHAN
4. JOINING UP WITH DELD IT WAS DECIDED THAT SOME POTIONS WOULD BE NEEDED 
FOR THE EXPLORATION. LUCKILY THE LABORATORY WAS JUST TO THE NORTHWEST OF 
TOWN
5. "IT WAS A MISTAKE COME INTO THE RUSTY NAIL" WHISPERED BEALAR "I THINK 
THIS IS THE LOCAL THIEVES' GUILD"
6. THE SEARCH FOR AN EMERALD KEY TOOK BEALAR AND COMPANY DEEP INTO THE 
RUINS OF ARGHAN
7. "WE ARE IN NEED OF MORE EXPERIENCE AND EQUIPMENT IF WE ARE TO GET 
FURTHER INTO THE RUINS" BEALAR TOLD DELD
8. STEPPING OUTDOORS BEALAR AND HIS PARTY FOUND THAT IT WAS ALREADY 
DARK. BEFORE THEY EVEN GOT A COUPLE OF BLOCKS TOWARDS SAFTEY A DOZEN 
ORCS ATTACKED

    After each story, you see:
THE OLD MAN FINISHES HIS STORY AND SAYS "COME BACK ANOTHER DAY AND I 
WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY" HE THEN WALKS OFF.

    7-2. TAVERN TALK

* THE PASSWORD IS 'BREAKFAST' (not sure what this is for)
* THERE IS A MAGIC SHOP IN THE NORTH-EAST CORNER OF THE INNER WALL
* WE WILL NEED AN EMERALD KEY TO ......
* WITHOUT A +5 WEAPON WE WON'T LAST FIVE MINUTES PAST THE FIRST TEMPLE

  8. CHEATING

The bluntest form of cheating is to run through the Palace, fight everyone, 
reboot, and run through it again when there are no monsters there. You 
sustain a lot less damage that way. But if you want to get technical and just 
run through the game, look below.

    8-1. DISK IMAGE

I haven't fully sharpened up the cheating on the Apple. However, 
critical character data is below for each slot(A-H):

Offset   |Attributes
---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
0000-0013|0-terminated character name
0014-0019|Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Max/Cur Life, Experience
001f-0020|Current Power/Maximum Power
0022     |prayer level
0025-0028|coins(copper/silver/electrum/gold)
002c-002d|Maximum Karma/Current Karma
0033-0048|Various character skills
004a-0050|Various character skills
0021/0051|morale loss
0060-009f|items(8 bytes per item)

A:  F620
B:  F6C0(note:  To edit anything after F6FF, start at F500 and not F700. In 
other words, subtract 200 from F6C0+offset)
C:  F560
D:  F400
E:  F4A0
F:  F340
G:  F3E0(note:  To edit anything after F3FF start at F200 and not F400.)
H:  F280

Examples:  Say you wanted to set character E's attributes all to 250. Pull 
out a hexadecimal calculator and...
F4A0+14=F4B4, F4A0+19=F4B9. So bytes F4B4 to F4B9 in your hexadecimal editor 
should become FA(250 in hexadecimal)...Repeat for the other offsets in the 
table.

However, say you wanted to set character G's skills to 199. 199 in hex is C7. 
But since the Apple reads "tracks" of 256 bytes backwards, F200 and not F400 
is immediately after F3FF, so 200 hex must be subtracted. So... F3E0+33=F413-
200=F213.
F3E0+48=F428-200=F228. So you would change bytes F213 to F228 to C7. Also you 
could change F22A to F230 to C7 and that would take care of all your 
abilities. To change your max/current power you would have to modify bytes 
F200 and F3FF. This is one of those "border cases."

Items are formatted as follows:

00 = descriptor 2
01 = descriptor 1
(see section 6 with key as 0 for the above. FF in the 1st means no item and 
FF in the 2nd means no 2nd descriptor.)
02 = spell type
03 = spell charges
04 = attribute
05 = bonus to attribute
06 = # of hands
07 = ready(hi byte 80)

    8-2. SAVE STATE

The AppleWin save state editing works the same way as disk images, only it 
has the added bonus of working after a combat when you don't have enough 
karma! You have the same relative offsets, but the absolute offset is 575e 
for your first player. Each character takes up 0xa0 bytes and the data is the 
same as above.

It's also useful to be able to modify items.

NOTE:  editing this way too soon may destroy your characters' abilities to 
pray(i.e. they can't). I think I tripped something I should not have and 
can't figure what. So be warned--byte editing can backfire. But also note 
that I won the game fairly easily with these changes, almost never sustaining 
life-draining damage from monsters. I think the best bet is to improve 
everything except Karma by a cheat and then improve Karma, because the game 
tends to tick off levels once you improve your maximum karma to whichever.

At 0x4070 you have the start of the 30-by-30 map where you can mess around. 
This isn't very helpful when you want to escape the town at night to get to 
the ruins, but you can edit a square so that you can leave the town for the 
north grasslands. You can also take the easy way through a dungeon, but 
that's going too far.

draft of the guide to my latest draft.
--All the people I met over the years at GameFAQs for keeping guide 
writing/old games fun.
--druadic@cs.com for the maps(from Quest for Clues I think) which made my 
walk-through MUCH easier(strangely, he didn't have the level 3 Tarmon's map--
but it exposed secret doors quickly for the other levels.)  His web page at 
members.nbci.com/druadic was a wonderful resource for maps in general.
--Kahei at Kahei.com for a marvelous hex editor that allowed me to 
concentrate on the puzzles.
--ftp.apple.asimov.net for the original Apple images.
--lordbub and CronoLV99 for their help in the Wizard's Crown topic, in 
specific places mentioned or where I may sadly have assimilated information, 
bumped it about in my unconscious, and watched it appear later. Psst...the 
topic that's closed because some idiots flooded it. I hope it makes it to the 
GameFAQs topic archive.
--Popcorn Demon for the tip of white rabbits in the 1-square patch. Again in 
that topic.
