  1. INTRODUCTION

I don't have the manual yet(or even a facsimile) so I can't give full details 
on the game. However, Eternal Dagger is a sort of Wizard's Crown kicked up a 
notch, in the outside world and with a few more attributes, more robust 
items, fuller dungeons, and tougher decisions to make. If you've played 
Wizard's Crown on the PC and wanted to play the sequel you've heard of, it's 
available via Apple emulation.

Your party has been beamed into the world of Eternal Dagger from the Wizard's 
Crown world. Again that whole force-of-evil thing. You start on Wizard's Isle 
and work your way to the Elven Isle and the Dwarven Isle in search of the 
Eternal Dagger, the only weapon that can seal off the portal from the Demon 
world where Anawt is sending the demons from.

Eternal Dagger is playable on an emulator. I recommend AppleWin. 
ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net has the images. You need to use ED1 and ED2 to 
boot, and use GDISK1 and GDISK2 for the games. Emulation save states and the 
acceleration feature allow you to breeze through this game much more quickly 
than when it came out, and so you can look at the side details more if you 
want. You can use save states, too(F11) and thus have multiple save slots to 
go exploring stuff with.

  2. CONTROLS

    2-1. BASIC STUFF

You have a sort of warped numpad that moves you around.

812
7 3
654

I just remember 1 is up and go from there. Moving diagonally doesn't cost any 
more time than moving in a straight line. You can move diagonally between 
barriers, most frequently mountains outside. You'll also want to learn about 
making camp. Stuff you need to know:

H) gets you to the heal menu where you can U)npoison, Treat D)isease F)irst 
aid, or P)ray. V) lets you view items with a certain character. P puts it in 
the backpack and you can take with T.

I-N-E-X is a useful combo to improve a character.

Remember to check in your backpack for day's rations to drop to make room for 
more valuable items.

    2-2. STRATEGIES(FIGHTING AND EXPLORING)

The golden rule is always to keep your fatigue under 20. Also, run if you're 
ever not sure you can win something, or your only Frequently Asked Question 
will be "Why didn't I save, again?" You'll have to rest it all off anyway, 
and if you're too tired and get diseased and can't cure it, that just piles 
things up. This game doesn't have a time limit, and while exploring in winter 
is irritating, reloading after getting and losing that reenforcing pendant 
and wizard's ring in the two of three fights you won is doubly so.

And I have found that staying up 'til 3AM without resting is conducive to not 
saving, too.

  3. CREATING/BUILDING A PARTY

    3-1. WHO TO GATE

Getting a party with the right abilities is a big choice. I hope I didn't 
sound too much like a guidance counselor there, but throwing statistics 
around gets you in trouble, as does trying to make too many characters good 
at too many attributes. You won't have the time or patience, even with quick 
combat, and monsters tend to thin out eventually anyways.

I find it useful to have everyone in the mix with a really good weapon. I 
also like having the best protection there is to offer. So I give everyone 16 
strength to start. Life isn't as critical as other things, so I give everyone 
50 to start. Then the rest goes to intelligence needed for a character class 
and then dexterity. You really need to combine fighter classes with others so 
they can use weapons besides daggers. You should also go for two-handed 
weapons over one-handed. They do more damage, The really tough monsters don't 
use bash damage, shields apparently break, and you get another spot free in 
your inventory. Eventually the administration required with shields will 
frustrate you if you're trying to get through quickly.

Tips below for who to create and what to improve to 250. Note that if you get 
rid of the current party, player H appears first when you gate new 
characters. I also recommend having player C be able to cure disease and 
player F be able to use first aid. That way their player-letters go with the 
heal-menu commands.

* fighter-sorcerer A(great axe)
* fighter-sorcerer B(hammer)
* fighter-sorcerer C(greatsword)
* fighter-priest A(greatsword)
  use experience points on Cure Disease
* fighter-priest B(maul)
  use experience points on Cure Poison, but only to 200
* fighter-priest C(large flail)
  use experience points on First Aid
* ranger(heavy spear)
  get 250 hunt, then 250 track, then spear
You can roll the dice on the final one:
* either thief(dagger) or fighter-thief(crossbow or greatsword)
  improve his search immediately, to find cool new items

The advantages of having a thief is extra dexterity and that he can use the 
Eternal Dagger later.

The fighter-thief will be very useful for combat early on, but the dexterity 
points will be wasted later. Also, having a fighter-thief means that someone 
else can use the Eternal Dagger in case that person doesn't get a magic item 
of his type. Swords tend to pop up more frequently than other types, just 
because special random items are determined not by item type but item name 
and there are many more sword types than not. You may even run out of 
experience points to allocate to your pure thief later.

    3-2. WHAT TO IMPROVE LATER

First, I recommend that you keep weapon skills at 250 as it gets too 
prohibitively expensive later to do otherwise. Also, if you don't know what 
to do, spend on dexterity. Eternal Dagger sometimes awards critical hits, and 
the more moves you have, the more chance you'll get one. Life really isn't as 
important, especially when your players use the Countermagic spell(even in 
quick combat,) which sometimes increase your life or even undoes injuries 
when an enemy hits you.

When a character gets a very-magic item(cold, holy, storm, flaming, life 
drain, i.e. something with magic damage too) then you can start to improve 
his weapon skill. It's nice to have a variety of damages and with randomly 
finding items that should happen. With the way we are playing, someone will 
be left in the cold with a magic weapon, leaving him to use the Eternal 
Dagger, which is an awesome weapon(25 holy, as opposed to the usual 5.) So he 
needs to improve Close Combat, which is not hard at all. But if he's improved 
another weapon skill to 500, that is at least 250*6=1500 experience wasted 
and possibly 2000/3000 that could have gone to dexterity or even 
life(75/100/150 points.) Plus, for critical battles such as versus Sri, 
you'll want to make sure you're as quick as possible. I've had a party who 
couldn't beat him. I improved everyone's dexterity to 50: a few easy wins. 
Life to 250: couldn't pull it off.

For the priestly skills, having a lot of karma means you can risk going 
further into dungeons. Since karma is the cheapest stuff in the game, improve 
that first after the initial boost. You want to make sure you are protected 
against diseases, which can tire a specific enemy of the party out. Later, 
before heading to the Dwarven Isle, you'll want to make sure Cure Disease is 
at 400. There are nasty monsters there whose disease mongering is tougher to 
cure.

See priests for sorcerers having power, although this does take a bit more 
experience per power point, and besides, you can regenerate power by resting. 
Get it up to 250 and then improve your dexterity on Wizard's Isle. Then on 
the Elven Isle branch out to Cast Spell points(250) and only then would you 
want to get your power up to 500. I did OK with Cast Spell around 300. You 
may need someone to improve it for Koruy. But improving your weapon skill may 
be cheaper and I'd advise doing that first.

It's tough to decide when to improve dexterity and when to improve skills, 
but I find that if I just forget to improve skills, and my experience is over 
100, I improve my dexterity.

Finally, life is OK if there is nothing else. I wouldn't know what to do with 
any spill-over points. Maybe one of those weird combat options such as scan 
or awareness. If you plan to try to cheat with several Eternal Daggers(the 
only good this does is that you may be able to thump Anawt at the end,) you 
can get everyone's Close Combat up. I'm not sure if this works but it's a 
try.

So, excluding weapon improvement, here are good paths, brackets meaning you 
can stagger things--get one to 250 before the other--and neglecting weapons 
and dexterity, which are at your discretion when you get a magic weapon:

Sorcerer-1 [Power-500] [Cast Spell-400]
Sorcerer-2 [Power-500]
Sorcerer-3 [Power-500]
Priest-1 Karma-500 Luck-200 [Cure Disease-400 Turn Undead-400]
Priest-2 Karma-500 Luck-200 Cure Poison-200 Turn Undead-400
Priest-3 Karma-500 Luck-200 First Aid-400 Turn Undead-400
Ranger Hunt-350 Track-350 Spear-350
Thief Search-500(for new items)
  (Picklock is not useful with a good mage.)

But if you just trust your instincts it shouldn't be too bad. Remember you 
can always find a pile of enemies, or just reset (especially) Koruy or (edit 
the save state for a quick path) Sri's, to run in and try again.

    3-3. POLICY FOR IMPROVING ITEMS

Now when you get magic items you'll realize that the Elves improve them for a 
fee, up to +6. It doubles, but 160 gold is hardly extortion. Note also that 
the Dwarves will do so, too, but they charge double what the Elves do. You'll 
also want to check the Enchanter's for possible good items. I've found 
Dwarven Plate and an Elven Ring, which have been incredibly useful.

Remember the only items really worth improving are (armor) reinforcing, 
dwarven, elven and (magic) storm, cold, flame, drain (proof) or holy. That 
gets you a magic protection/damage in addition to other things. Also note 
that if you ready a +3 bracelet and a +3 storm proof ring, you only get the 
greater of the two bonuses, not a combo.

This means that once you find good armor, you will want to keep it. Usually 
the best sort is dwarven/elven/reinforcing(the third seems rarest as it only 
appears randomly) so if you find any of this in Chain or better, you may want 
to improve it. Of course, if you find Wizard's armor, even Cuirboilli, it is 
worth readying to +6 and improving. That protects you almost completely from 
magic.

Also note the following 2 related combos:
Dwarf Plate + storm pendant
bash/cut/thrust 8-42-9 physical + 30-2-2-2 protection
Storm Plate + dwarf pendant
8-12-9-32-2-2-2 + 0-30-3 protection = 8-30-9-30-2-2-2
(12 less protection versus bash.)

to +1: 5 gp
to +2: 10 gp
to +3: 20 gp
to +4: 40 gp
to +5: 80 gp
to +6: 160 gp

However, the first best thing to improve is your magic item. Don't 
necessarily improve it to +6, but it's a can't-miss. Alternate between that 
and any physical-protect-enhanced armor. Remember also to try to build up 
+5/+6 for anything Dwarven or Elven and only then do you want to go with 
storm/drain proof etc.

When deciding between, say, a +5 and a +3 item, see how much each would 
improve your total resistance. Say +5 were cold-proof and +3 were storm-
proof. Improving the storm-proof would improve storm resistance by 2. 
Improving the cold-proof would improve the others by 2. So +3 wins out--3 
improvements for 1/4 the price--but +5 would next time.

Also don't worry too much about the damage a physical weapon does. For swords 
if it's something like a rapier, you may want to wait for something cooler as 
there areso many swords out there, but whatever magic item you get is 
probably OK for other weapons. Plus, for someone with a 1-handed weapon, it's 
nice to be able to ready a +x (physical protect) gem. Much better than a 
shield. Again, go with the flow here and don't worry too much about what you 
find or don't find. Your party will eventually find cool items and improve.

While some items seem marginally useless I keep all "proof" stuff that can be 
worn. Also I try to spread out +6's early on among players so everyone has 
one, which affords basic protection against magic attacks. Generally it's 
good to get really wimpy stuff to +2, but your main stuff(armor and weapons 
and Wizard's anything) should go to +6 right away.

Money shouldn't be too much of a problem. There are plenty of monster groups 
that hoard Chain Mail, and you'll find dwarves with magic chain mail and 
items of their own. You can even fight elven and dwarven patrols(15 gold of 
goods per fighter) when you're very good, but you probably don't need much 
improvement. Cross your fingers for someone jumping you at random. Then you 
get the weapon stash guilt free.

One other thing--you probably won't get magic Plate Mail for everyone. You 
can wait this out a bit but Chain or Scale with Dwarven/Elven is good enough. 
I really recommend Dwarven/Elven/Reenforcing armor as opposed to X-proof 
because it protects you against one special form of attack even more than 
rings can. With 3 types of physical attack and 4 magic, a +30 to blocking 
physical attack seems slightly more valuable, and you can get a bigger 
maximum protect against cut or bash or thrust due to the initial protection 
armor gives. Magic-proof items do seem to occur in greater quantities anyway. 
If you want to bail out and not worry about things, just buy +1 Elven Chain 
Mail at Sea Haven or take what you loot from the Dwarven Patrols that 
(eventually) ambush you.

    3-4. POLICY FOR GETTING MONEY

Put all armor in your backpack. Even lame seeming armor is better than the 
best weapon. My rule of thumb on weapons is that anything over 1000 can go in 
your backpack, but you can also drop that stuff based on backpack space. If 
nobody seems to have backpack space, drop whatever daily rations you 
can(they're only worth 20 bucks.)  Be aggressive about what you take. 
Especially early on when you don't stray far from a town, you can get the 
chain mail and longswords of undead warriors, for instance. Obviously you'll 
want to take most magical items but you'll also want to check which are the 
most valuable--potions can be worth up to 1800. Also some valuable nonmagic 
items are duds, but stuff like Emeralds can clearly benefit your pocketbook 
if you pick them up. You'll learn to evaluate, etc. And note that +40 to a 
skill can make something very valuable.

Remember also simple things like never put a small item in the backpack if 
you have space in your hands. You should also be keeping spare bandainds for 
your first aid person but if there is an excess you can pitch one or two as a 
last resort--they often pop up after combat anyway.

Of course when you start to fill up it's time to retreat, and if you have 
that one last fight and still have some open spaces, you can fill up on junk.

Finally, if you know where a treasure trove is, first rest up so fatigue is 
zero(and search is at its best) and save the game/save-state before 
searching. That way, if you get a dud, you can reload and retry.

    3-5. A DUMB CHEAT WITH EMULATORS

This one's pretty simple. Save the emulator state before entering a treasure 
trove. You can usually count on there being one game-improving magic 
item(special magic protection or magic weapon) per trove. Don't let yourself 
get ripped off.

TREASURES

  Treasures are random, but often certain groups of treasures are 
guarded by several of the same sort of monster.  Often after one 
encounter you will be able to F)ollow tracks, leading to more monsters--
a sign you're on to something.  When the number of monsters that attack 
you starts to decrease, you can anticipate treasure soon.  They are also 
the best ways to find unique armor/weapons that can improve your party 
in ways experience alone can't.
  Here's a rough outline of where treasure is:

  WIZARD'S ISLE
  Try your luck close to the mountain range.  Also be sure to T)alk to 
the only people you see and you'll get a Dragon Slaying Longsword.  This 
is handy when you meet the Dragon in the southeast to raid his horde.  
There's also treasure before you enter the Necromancer's.

  ELVEN ISLE
  East of Koruy there are a bunch of Flits/Flitters.  I imgaine there's 
other treasure around Koruy.

  DWARVEN ISLE
  Treasure is found where the mountains almost meet the sea.  It's tough 
to get at but is very valuable as well.  The mountain map is like a 
starfish, and the "tendrils" all have treasure at the end.

  DUNGEONS
  You can mine for minimal treasure in Sri's dungeon.  However, the best 
guaranteed treasure comes from the Weapons Masters who all have +2 
Plate.  There is a +6 Storm Spear in the Underwater Dungeon(just before 
you have to get rid of it.  Gee, whiz, great...
  Of course, if you are not above minor-league cheating, you can reset 
Koruy and Sri's Lair and keep picking up cash.  You can even reset 
Waddling Turtle and Magoomba's dungeons and re-kill them, but the 
benefits are not worth the risk.  Going through Avlis's tower again is 
possible but it's such a hassle to solve the puzzles and put up with 
Avlis's tricks that you're better off beating up monsters outside, which 
gets you experience too.

  4. MONSTERS

  Here's a brief table of the major monster attributes.  It includes all 
monsters.  Note that some monsters of the same name have different abilities. 
Some also have different items, etc. when you kill them.

  5. ITEMS

This lists the items and their relative prices.  Note that some of these 
are not stand-alone items:  "dragon's" or "holy," for instance, are 
prefixes, as is "the eternal." Note that you get a 40 gold bonus for any 
skill an item might have(i.e. +40 mace skill=1600 gold,) and spells give a 
different bonus as well.

You also get a 1024 bonus for each level of magic an item is increased by. 
Obviously some items must stand alone(a map) and some get paired with 
modifiers(dragon's teeth) but you can combine the worth of an item if you are 
curious.

The binary format for items is as follows:

byte 0=item descriptor 1
byte 1=item descriptor 1
byte 2=spell type
byte 3=# charges
byte 4=skill
byte 5=skill to improve
byte 6=lo bytes=# hands
       next lo=size(S=0 M=1 L=2)
       top 4=3 if armor, 7 if weapon??--don't touch.
byte 7: top 3 bytes=magic charge(up to 7)
        other 5 bytes=strength to wear

  7. MAIN WALKTHROUGH

Basically, everything important to finding items is done in a dungeon, though 
items are probably more restricted to treasures or tough combats. So this 
walkthrough is probably more dungeon-intensive. For improving your characters 
I can only offer the following advice: rest up. Don't let fatigue get over 
60. It will mean the difference between routing and being routed. If you 
think maybe you should go back, go back. When you get a valuable item, save 
the game. I'll be giving directions even for simple items here, so don't feel 
dumb or patronized unless it helps you in some disturbing strange way I'd 
probably rather not know about.

  7. MAIN WALKTHROUGH

First, read section 3 if you have any questions. Second, I always play on 
Easy, because it doesn't seem to affect the experience you get, and it 
doesn't mean any fewer monsters.

    7-1. ABOVE WIZARD'S ISLE

This is where you start out with your shiny new party. Stick to the plains 
for now and save after each fight. Forests can contain Moving Trees, and 
swamps can contain Swamp Things, which are a bit too tough at the start. 
However, undead farmers and the necromancer's companies are just fine for 
kicking off.

In general the experience you get, and the number of monsters you fight, 
decreases with each time you fight, so you really have to spread your party 
around. There are several treasure troves, but you may want to improve your 
search ability before looking for them. There's a dragon in the SE that 
fights you, and you can get Dragon's Teeth from him, which are useful for 
later.

While you run around you can improve your maximum karma early on. Each time 
you do, you get a point for your actual karma. This makes you less likely to 
have to go back to the temple. If you give all your bandages to one guy who 
is good at first aid, you'll save on small ticky-tack prayers immensely.

While you're traipsing around you'll want to find Greenbay(Lambeaufield not 
included.) It's in the south, across a swamp, and you'll want to had in from 
the NE in order to get there with as little chance as possible of tipping off 
the swamp beasts. Save before walking across. Nothing but the temple is 
operative right now, but that helps boost your karma. Have your priests spend 
everything they have on karma. You should need 500 experience points to get 
to the top. With that, you can then trek to the Necromancer's Cave.

But first let's review where we can find treasure. You can usually clear the 
monsters guarding the treasure before you search for it. To do that, just 
keep loitering/searching/following tracks until there's only one kind of 
monster attacking you with the same dialog. If you want, you can save after 
each won fight. Because you may want to wait to improve your search to 300+ 
and rest up too(zero fatigue) before proceeding--a bit better chance of good 
items that way. And I will not dirty mack you out if you save before 
searching to get something good. All you need is one cool item(extra 
magic/physical protection, or magic weapon) per horde and you are in great 
shape.

4E you have fights with trolls and goblins. You can win these out of the 
gate, but as I mentioned before, you might want to wait to improve your 
searching before looking inside.

A bit further east(4E2S in fact) are some ogres looking for rebels. Say you 
are the rebels, and they will attack you. There should be two fights before 
you find their cave.

In the pass east of the main mountain range, trolls/goblins/sorcerers ask you 
for your papers. Say you have them and sneak up. There are about five fights 
here.

On the other side of the mountain are two tougher-to-find caves. 3N3E of the 
tower is the Lizard Men's cave. Be rested for these guys. They're tough.

Then 7E1N of the Wizard's Tower you have a cave of items from adventurers you 
may or may not have fought. They are seen as "armed men" and if you talk you 
get a Dragon Slaying Longsword(whoop-te-doo) but if you don't, you can win a 
very lucrative battle with all manner of +1 chain mail and special items and 
gold, and you can uncover the cave at the listed location.

Then finally in the NW you have some fights with undead warriors that lead to 
probably the biggest bonanza of a cave on Wizard's Isle. If you search under 
it, you can pop out on the other side where you'll find the Necromancer's 
Cave after a few more fights with undeads. It's time to go in there, unless 
your karma is below 2/3 of its maximum. If in doubt, go back and maybe win a 
few more fights and return

    7-2. THE NECROMANCER'S CAVE

It's best to enter this cave with no fatigue. You may need to exit and rest 
and re-enter for the final fight. It's a pretty route-one affair, with a few 
puzzles about reading something somewhere and using it somewhere else, and a 
secret door based on what part of the map you haven't been to yet. You have a 
few doors to unlock and some cool side treasures. Once you win the 
Necromancer's Cave, it's destroyed, the island is reorganized, nobody there 
attacks you any more, and Greenbay isn't just a temple, it's a whole town.

      7-2-1. LEVEL 1

The door at the end of the corridor opens up onto some undead warriors. You 
can talk to the skull another room down if you want, but he only says to look 
for secret doors. Going to the DL of the level you'll fight some more undeads 
and you'll open a room to the right. In the center, you have undead animals. 
Unless your Cure Disease is very high(250+,) don't mess with them. They'll 
take you out. In fact, unless you've spent exclusively on dexterity you're in 
trouble anyway.

To the north and then to the west/north you have some side rooms with clues 
about the door's and the floor's names(WNPT and IXL.) Even better, you have 
Weapons Masters to fight. They have +2 Plate. It can give you a temporary 
armor boost, and you'll need all you can get. Put the magic stuff--or even 
your old plate mail at a cool 5 gold per--in your backpack. Then get on with 
things.

Off to the east is the main passage. You'll go into a library where you'll 
want a thief to search the suspicious bookcase. This opens the door to 
another fight. To the right is another door leading up, and then there's 
another skull who wants to talk to you. He's got a pair of dragon teeth, but 
you probably already beat up the dragon, so don't bother. Behind this room 
you have the stairs to level 2.

      7-2-2. LEVEL 2

To the left you enter a room with infinite undead warriors. Use the dragon 
teeth as fighting them leads to a loss without combat. South to an open room 
and east to one with an easy fight. Don't worry about the chests(bandages and 
spices) but the next fight will be tough, minotaurs and such. Always have 
magic on for these. You'll have to pass the door in the SE now. WNPT gets you 
through and then after some zigzagging you have another big fight with 
mummies and minotaurs, etc. Trash them and now S-E-N you can find 
necromancers to the east. You can get a +50 Luck scarab on the table after 
winning the fight or you can just enjoy the experience. If you took the east 
fork you could read some information of what Anawt plans to do with the 
world.

But you want to go west to finish things. In the NE corner of this what-
passes-for-a-maze you have a skull. Talk to it. It tells you the hall's name 
is ROLF. But where is the hall? Well, there's that central blob that's not 
been found yet. Search all the walls near it. Ah-ha. It's the SW corner, 
west-ish side. You can go east through the hall and reach double doors to the 
north.

Heal everyone and save here. If you can't win the fight, then maybe you need 
to reset the dungeon, plow through, reap the experience and improve your 
dexterity a few times--it seems to be more efficient than wandering around 
looking for fights, although you may need to reload karma too. You'll get 
more nice treasure out of it later. But it only took me a couple of cracks to 
win. Once you have, leave. The dungeon collapses on your exit.

      7-2-3. THE AFTERMATH

Farmers will cheer you as you loop around the mountains and go back to 
Greenbay. The swamp protecting it is gone! It's a real town now! Check the 
items being sold at the Enchanter's. I've gotten a Cold Spear(paralyze,) and 
I believe the items are random only to the point of being one of ten or so 
choices.

Sell your valuable items and buy some enchantments. I was able to get quite a 
few items to +4. Be sure to visit the temple and leave 1000 copper for the 
boat to the Elven Isle. You don't ever need to come back here unless you want 
to check on the magic items. Which may in fact be useful--save, camp outside 
and rest and see what the next item is. You should be able to save and 
restore if it's something you don't like. You can get a partial arsenal of 
the sort of magic items you'll need later in the game.

The items are:
+2 flaming broadsword +30 sword
life drain great axe
+1 storm longbow
+1 cold flail
cold spear +25 spear, paralyze
====not so useful
+3 silver claymore
+7 venemous rapier(which is very tempting) +100 unlock
javelin(lightning)


    7-3. THE ELVEN ISLE, GETTING STARTED

You'll probably need to improve a bit before fighting Magoomba. You should 
probably make, as your goal, getting one protective item to +5 and/or one 
weapon to +5 for each player, assuming you have them.

The two towns in the Elven Isle are Sea Haven(north, where you start) and 
Lotharia. Progress between them should not impede you, but the side ventures 
are a bit more tricky. They are relatively friendly and safe. You'll also 
meet some friendly NPC's. Be sure to talk to everyone you see as it is not a 
good idea to fight some of them. Turtles and Eagles in particular are tough. 
Some enemies are ambiguous, too, like trees--which can be friendly.

I don't recall anything bad happening if you fight foxes, and I don't think 
there's any retribution for fighting elves, but best to play it safe--
although if you can beat up a group of elves and get away with it, that's a 
lot of extra cash for you. They all have +1 Elven Chain Armor, which you can 
sell. If you are using an emulator, just save the state when elves talk to 
you. If you fight and can win, bonanza! If not, well, you can just reload and 
walk away. It's worth trying after each set of improvements you make. Beating 
up a group of 15 gets you 135 gold pieces' worth of mail, which is almost one 
+5->+6 advancement.

Lotharia has a +1 Elven Ring for sale and is closer to the first place you 
need to visit so you should get down there as soon as possible.
It also seems to alternate randomly between these and possibly others. A new 
magic item appears if you buy it, but there's no law against going right to 
the market and selling it back. A partial list of what's in either town is 
below:

+1 Elven Ring
Flame Proof Ring
========
+3 Lycanthrope Slaying Longbow
+1 Elven Chain
+4 Silver Necklace
Emerald treat disease+50
Spices treat poison+75
+3 Jade Crown
+3 Longbow bow+50

Therefore, you can get +1 Elven Rings for everyone as long as you follow the 
pattern of buying and selling a bunch, resting a day, and returning. This is 
probably best accomplished at the end of a long campaign. You might be able 
to finagle the randomnes by waiting around and with save-states it's readily 
accomplishable.

Now once you've gotten these neat items you probably want to go find ways to 
get gold to charge them up. You should be able to beat up enemies on the 
eastern part of this screen if you rest up enough. You can even go off the 
screen to the right, but don't go on the desert yet. You'll still want to 
improve dexterity, and every time you meet a Necromancer's Company, put the 
longswords in your backpack. If you face undead warriors, so much the better. 
That's chain mail, 3500 instead of 750 copper. This may not seem like much 
but 4 fights against 15 enemies each makes for 45 gold. You'll be finding 
other wealth, too.

Be sure you can whip black trees before facing Magoomba. He's a tough 
customer. You can find him east of the woods of Lotharia.

    7-4. MAGOOMBA'S

There's not much to do here except fight Magoomba. He'll probably be the last 
one to go down. Magoomba's is roughly east of Lotharia. It's guarded by black 
trees and necromancer's companies(wimpy undeads.) It is 3W of the base of the 
mountain range. Black trees always seem to be hanging around here so they are 
probably good for a few fights if you need to build up your experience.

Re-setting Magoomba's will not get you another Living/Eternal Dagger. Sorry. 
After this you can retreat to Lotharia or Sea Haven for the next bit.

    7-5. KORUY, THE DESERT AND THE TEMPLES

You've got a big trek ahead of you. The area east of Sea Haven, on the next 
screen entirely(you'll go off right of one) is much more treacherous. You can 
probably run from most fights, but if you want them, you can get a lot of 
experience. There are several treasure troves to uncover here. You can beat 
up hill men in the SW or walk along the south coast for relatively less 
turbulent fights and build up dexterity there. Or you can walk into the 
desert.

Sand swimmers appear on the rivers, and there are ant colonies, lizard men 
and Great Wyrms(very tough) to fight. The sort of enemy you encounter in NPC 
dialog doesn't fully reveal what you'll have to fight. It can vary. So be 
cautious and save frequently. And keep your fatigue very low.

Koruy is at the very north center of the desert, and the dungeon of Koruy is 
in the northeast of Koruy. You probably won't want to go there right away, 
and when you do you'll want to avoid the other city squares. The place is 
crawling with cockroaches, who are really nasty customers.

You will probably want to visit the abbess in the eastern temple, which is 
inside some mountains east of Koruy. She gives advice, and you recharge your 
karma. In the pass between the mountain and the sea you'll go by a cave that 
many groups of flits/flitters are guarding. Don't try to take care of them 
until after you've gone to the temple. In fact you may be so bogged down with 
stuff you may not be able to take all the treasure they have. But rest 
assured you can come back later and finish the trick. With the temple so near 
the fights are easily winnable without penalty.

The abbott in the temple to the west is also behind some flits that guard 
treasure between the sea and a mountain. Be sure to check him out later. One 
curious thing about the western temple is that elven patrols are there in 
spades. You can't move a few squares without talking to them. So after you've 
cleared the flits and flitters, you can beat up a few elf patrols for mucho 
gold, if you need that to charge certain items up.

The desert itself holds two caves. You'll see a river fork in the center of 
the desert. 4L2U and 4R2D of where the right fork starts, you'll find a cave, 
guarded by dragon men and/or lizard men. They're very much worth it, but 
don't overload yourself with treasure. You can always come back. You'll pick 
up good incidental experience along the way.

But what you really need to do is get through the Koruy Dungeon. It's not a 
big one, but the last fight is tough, at first. If you come back later, of 
course, it'll be easier, and you can still pile up considerable gold at low 
risk. I recommend that if you're out of ideas and not quite up to the Dwarf 
continent. Still, the first time through, save after every fight. They're all 
lucrative, for experience and saleable items.

      7-5-1. KORUY DUNGEON

Rest up before entering. Spiral around and when you see secret doors in the 
west wall, go there. There's a fight with dragon men. Now you can check out 
the door to the south. A fight with a dragon and then you can see a secret 
door to the east with six gold chests. Half are rigged. Start with the upper-
left chest and then open every other one to leave ~40 gold pieces richer.

Now go north to the old room and north again. More dragon men. You should be 
able to dispatch them. Then head east. Heal everyone before busting the door 
down. These enemies reappear after you think you've killed them.

Once you've won this fight, search the left bookcase with your thief. A 
skeleton key--use it later. The corner chests have some very nice gold, so 
don't overlook them. Head back through the secret doors and take the spiral 
counterclockwise. At the end is a door to a room with undead warriors and a 
liche, and then a room behind that holds ghosts. Nothing too taxing.

After that detour, you can head through two pairs of double doors east of the 
spiral. A fight with dragon men and children. Go south and then Examine for a 
peg 1N of the third barrel from the left. Examine north of the NW corner and 
open the door. More dragon men! But don't worry. There's not much left to map 
out. The princess the abbess was banging on about is in a room behind the NE 
wall. Have one player ready the skeleton key and then the princess will bless 
The Living Dagger and change it to The Eternal Dagger, which gives it 25 holy 
damage instead of 5, by the way. You can enchant it to +6, too. Whoever 
doesn't have a nice magic item yet can handle it. Now take off for Sea Haven. 
Sell your stuff and go to Waddling Turtle's. He has an item for you.

    7-6. WADDLING TURTLE'S

Waddling Turtle is in a hut on the river in the mountains in the western 
Elven Isle. The river has dead ends to the west and north. He's in the north. 
Search to enter. Go up to him and talk. He'll see you have the dagger, and 
you'll get a map for your troubles. Don't try to steal from the chest. It's a 
long hard fight, poor experience, and lousy treasure.

    7-7. GREY EAGLE'S

Before looking for Grey Eagle make sure you have/will buy 50' of rope to 
climb the mountain to get there. Grey Eagle is on the southwest coast, on a 
patch of hills between mountains and the sea. There's only one(this 
mountain/sea thing is a pattern throughout the game.) Grey Eagle is in the 
very north, 2U2R of another eagle. He'll give you a Bag of Wind for Avlis's 
Tower. You can tackle that now, since there's really only one challenging 
fight. Just be sure the party's well rested.

    7-8. AVLIS'S TOWER

A really nutty dungeon that's one-way to get in but not too hard to get out 
of if you're good with fiendish puzzles. The main problem is the big fight 
with the Big Man may be sticky, but once you find the Cloak of Feathers he's 
hiding and you get out, you can go see Grey Eagle.

      7-8-1. LEVEL 1

Pay 20 copper to enter. You can open the treasure in the next room after 
this. You'll fight Jacks, and then the door to the north will open. Find 
another door to the NE. Then you'll fight some howlers. Again, not bad. In 
the SE is a door to a secret room where there's a +7 greatsword. Too bad it 
doesn't have any modifiers or it'd be totally kickass. But it's still cool to 
find something +7 when you can only enchant to +6.

Now a room, hall and room later you'll have to give the right answer to a 
puzzle. Examine 1N of the door. The answer is 7. (Brief explanation of the 
solution:  the person with 5 cakes gives away 2 1/3 to the person with no 
cakes. Each cake costs 3 gold as the people have a total of 24 gold. So #1 
has 15 gold's worth of cakes, #2 has 9, and #1 needs to give 7 and 1 
respectively.)

Next room, a fight with jesters, which is pretty easy. The door reads "ETESH 
STEJRES TEIFGRH LAEIYS" = "These jesters frighten easily" garbled. Then there 
are some gorillas.

For the countdown room, push the red button and wait, although there's an 
amusing message if you pull a bunch of levers first.  You see, letting time 
run out is the solution. There are lots of puzzles here that are fun to try 
but aren't necessary to 
solve the game. For instance, the trickiest one is the cryptogram below, 
where a slash delineates letters:

    1&/-1/-/-11/-/  1/&1/  --/  -&/&/&/-11/ &&-/-/-1/1/11&/-&/  1&/-1/-/
    &&-/-/-&/  1/11&/  1&/-1/-/  -1/&/1--/&-/  -11/&/&/111/ 

"There is a door behind the bed in the howl room." But you knew that already, 
because I told you. I basically started with assuming the 1-letter word was a 
and guessed that & must be a vowel. It worked.

After the trick room, statues say "You'd better look sharp/and watch your 
head/cause if you don't/you'll wind up dead.--Alvis" take the NE door and 
fight some demons after the hall. D-L-U and it's the stairs to level 2.

      7-8-2. LEVEL 2

Level 2 has some good fights to the north after you get past the first door. 
The first one features weapon masters with +2 Plate and +2 Life Drain 
Longbows. If you'd like to, you can search the center of the bookcase to the 
right to find the Bag of Winds. Then Avlis is a couple of rooms away. The 
Feathered Cloak is in the fireplace, 3rd-left square. Get it and you hear 
something click. It's in the right passageway after you go back. You'll see 
some statues at the end of the passage.

You will want to close all the doors past the statues--close the outer ring 
first, then close all the doors to the center room. Then jump in the flame, 
and you will have left Avlis's Tower. The puzzle of the statues deserves some 
explanation. The Left statue says he is next to Truth, so he can't be Truth. 
The Middle statue can't be Truth(he says he's Diplomacy), so the Right must 
be. Therefore the Middle statue must be Lies(as Right says) and Left must be 
Diplomacy(sometimes tells truth)--therefore you do as the right statue says. 
Close all the doors. If you don't, you are transported to a south room(the 
one you can't open the door to) and given a combat. Repeated mistakes when 
you step on the central flame lead you east, and eventually mistakes will 
send you to the third room east where you will keep fighting a tough and a 
toughie. Also be aware that you don't have to close the doors outside of the 
room, and doing so is no substitute for closing doors inside the room(as I 
found out!)

Close-e 4N 2W 2S 2W close-e 2W 6S close-e 3S E 3S 2E close-w 2E close-e 2NW 
2N and close all the doors inside before stepping into the flame. BLAM! 
You're evicted. You can go back to Grey Eagle's now, but he'll just tell you 
you need Aqua Helms. So now it's time to visit the Dwarven Isle.

    7-9. THE DWARVEN ISLE, EXPLORING

Dwarf Hold, where you arrive, has some useful items, although the sell-buy 
trick doesn't work so well. They charge double what elves do!

+1 dwarven plate
+5 flaming battle axe
+7 dwarven diamond
========
+1 gold heavy crossbow
+3 storm heavy spear
+3 dwarven chain
+2 dwarven chain(only need 10 strength)
+5 dwarf hammer
+3 giant slaying dwarf hammer

One thing to watch through all this is that you want to save 10 gold for 
return trips. You may only make one trip here, but you want it to be 
successful.

Fighting dwarf patrols is very lucrative because you can get a lot of nice 
treasure from them. But the problem is that everyone will fight you from then 
on. Just take what comes when Dwarf Patrols surprise you; the Elven Isle is 
better and safer for gold anyway. Also, beware of dwarves surprising you when 
you step on Dwarf Hold. It's happened to me.

Now there is a cheat where you can change a byte in the save state to get to 
Sri's easily. It's byte 423f and if you change it from 6 to 7, voila! You can 
walk through the center of the mountain. But if you want to play it honest, 
here's what to look for.

If you want to go exploring then I recommend looking at the right side first. 
The caves are a bit closer, the monsters are easier, and Sri's Lair is a more 
direct diagonal shot. Of course you can go down the right arm and back down 
the left(circling around and completing Sri's would probably overload you,) 
or do whatever you want. You probably don't need much treasure right now, and 
the critical fight is Sri's. Beat him and you have very little combat left to 
go through. Then get out of this crazy place where dwarves insult you and 
charge gold for silly advice and offer you an insulting 3 silver a week to 
work on the sewers(you can make more than that resting and getting extra 
rations.)

You also want to have Treat Disease at 400 for your one priest. Monsters are 
vicious here at that, and getting something hard to cure will waste a lot if 
time. Once again you'll find caves between the mountains and the sea, and 
they are full of treasure.

On the north coast it's empty.
On the west coast a dwarf family gives advice.
Lower down you fight Arcturus, the hardest fight.
In the southwest are yeti.
In the southeast are demons with wolves.
In the northeast you have ice people.


Sri's lair is in the south hilly area, at the north end--the east of two 
squares. Search and enter.

    7-10. SRI'S LAIR LEVEL 1

Sri's lair has lots of demons. There's some good treasure, too, and it's a 
weird winding maze where the final fight is really nasty. Many side paths 
contain vampire bats, etc., and there is even a slave pit where you can break 
your back mining for silver.

The initial fight with vampire bats is a walkover. If you want, some lesser 
demons guard money to the left behind two doors. The first door north leads 
to more bats and demons(west) and ghouls(north.) But you want to take the far 
door. The trip north is uneventful until you go to the deep caverns.

      7-10-2. LEVEL 2

You've got a big fight before walking across the bridge. There's no way to 
fall off, and it doesn't look that impressive, but eh well. The west wall 
beyond has a secret door, too. It leads to goblins and copper. Whoopee! 
There's a secret door before that room, but it doesn't lead to that much 
more. Search the tables for moot loot.

Troglodytes are beyond the next door to the north, though. Then a door left. 
A deetour door down leads to werewolves then high demons behind another door. 
Then you can get some gold if you want.

Back at the branch open the door left. The next door left leads to spiders, 
then demons to the south, but going down from here(a right-down door leads to 
a room with damaging rubble and electrum) leads back to the "level 1" area, 
which they try to pass off as level 3, but it's just too close to the level 1 
low-rent stuff to fool anyone.

      7-10-3. LEVEL 3(NOT REALLY, LEVEL 1)

You'll fight some demons and beyond the next door you have Sri and his 
demons. After winning this fight you need to go around the bookcase through 
the secret doors. To simplify things, give everyone a backpack space free so 
he can take an Aqua Helm. Open the north chest. Make sure there's no message 
about how some people can't take helms, or if there is, drop or trade 
something. The south has treasure, if you want, or you can just retrace your 
steps and get out.

      7-10-4. BACK TO THE ELVEN ISLE

You've got everything now. Visit Grey Eagle again. Be sure you have 50' of 
rope(buy it in Lotharia if need be.) If everyone has an aqua helm, he'll fly 
you to Enolho.

    7-11. ENOLHO

If you're a moron, you'll drop an Aqua Helm and then nobody can enter Enolho, 
and you're stuck. But you're not. Are you? Eh? A bit slow to respond there, 
buddy boy. H'm. Seems everyone's the sort who is not patient enough to read a 
game's details, or they get bogged down in the details just trying to solve 
it.

Anyway, there's not much to do here. There are some tough fights, but you'll 
want to save your energy for the Demon World. When you step away from the 
stairs, your first fight with Eels begins. You can get a +6 storm spear for 
all the good it'll do you. You'll have to chuck it to get through the portal, 
anyway.

Opening the door leads to a combat with sharks, who are also pretty tough. 
Most of the outer rooms are empty, and there's a circular hallway(yes, it's 
rectangular, but it circles around) inside the one you're in. Inside that is 
a very tough fight with mermen and some interesting books, but nothing to get 
too excited about.

Sharks are in the NW room, guarding worthless treasure. Mermen guard +6 
Wizard's Plate(a bit late now) in the SE. Demons are in the roow 2 doors 
down. They are guarding the portal to the demon world. Fight them, drop 
everything but The Eternal Dagger, and walk through. If you're held back by 
an unseen force, check everyone's inventory. Check their backpacks too. But 
you can keep your gold!

There's some exhortation to "remember POKIP" but it never gets used.

    7-12. THE DEMON WORLD

Here, without any items, you'll need to scrounge for something nice just to 
make SURE you win your fights. You've probably been ambushed before without 
armor, so you shouldn't worry about the first fight. If you're lucky you'll 
get a magic item, but it doesn't matter because you don't need to fight to 
win, and the optional fight with Anawt(if you dawdle in the final room) is 
impossible without incredible item finding luck.

There'll be an initial encounter with undead warriors. You can probably 
"take" them even without much in the way of armor. The secret door to the 
west leads to a moderately tough maze. Remember that stepping on a rubbish 
pile may shift the dungeon around--empty spaces now have walls, and vice 
versa. Fortunately there are no dead ends and you can often re-trace your 
steps or go back to the beginning relatively easy. And at 15x15 it's not 
impossible. There's a spoiler below as to how to get through the maze, but 
it's fun to try out. In any case you are never penalized too badly for a 
mistake.

A rule of thumb is that any one square with rubble will shift you to the same 
maze regardless of the maze you're on. However, it may replaced by a wall in 
another version of the maze.

1 = maze resets to #1
2 = maze resets to #2
3 = maze resets to #3
v = stairs
< = entrance

Once past the maze(you've touched the "stairs" which are really a teleporter) 
and beaten the lesser demons, find the secret door to the east. Well, 
actually it's SE-NE-etc over this weird checkerboard  until the passage opens 
up. Then go SE, then NE/SE until you can go SE again. SE, SW and you'll 
teleport to the SE room of the Demon's World. There's a fight with undead 
warriors. It shouldn't be tough at all. You can upgrade armor here if you 
want.

A secret door on the north wall, 1W from the right. Then again on the north 
wall, far west. Enter the next room and have your player with the dagger 
lead. Face the table. Examine it. "Destroy it Y/N?" Yes.

You can wait around and see how badly Anawt kicks your butt if you want, but 
once you've killed the portal for good, the screen blinks, and your party is 
in a peaceful glade far from home or the Demon's World. Your characters' 
icons are arranged in an octagon, with tree icons around. The game freezes. 
You've won! Sadly, the sequel this ending implied was never produced--or I 
never heard about it. If you did, or even if you have some neat fan fiction, 
write me at the address below. Or even if you just enjoyed this game, and 
this walkthrough helped you etc.

ULTRA-CONDENSED WALKTHROUGH

This touches over some details so if you miss something here, you may 
get close to the end only to realize that you're trapped.  But that's 
the +/- to a total spoiler.  Details(except for actual puzzle solutions) 
are above...

  Necromancer's cave is pretty much linear.  The Door, Floor and Hall 
are named WNPT, IXL, and ROLF respectively.  Name them and the 
necromancer is behind a secret door to the east(examine to reveal it) in 
the southwest corner.  Once the 
cave is destroyed, Greenbay(the city in the south) will come to life.  
Use it to rest and go to the Elven isle.

  Magoomba's Grove(SE Elven):  Get in, kill Magoomba, get out.

  Koruy(NE Elven):  remember the secret door west of the spiral.  Get 
the skeleton key, and go into the southeast--turn the peg on the north 
shelf, go northwest, and ready the key and rescue the princess.

  Waddling Turtle's(Upstream/North of the lake):  Talk to him when you 
have the dagger and he'll give you a map.

  Grey Eagle's(1)(SW Elven):  Get the bag of Wind.

  Avlis's Tower(NW Elven):  Use the bag of wind to enter.  Be sure 
you've rested beforehand--you can't get out!  Puzzles can be solved by 
trial and error if nothing else, except the "countdown" puzzle--just 
wait.  Avlis is the first door north, and you get the feathers from him.  
Past the statues you will want to close ALL the doors before stepping in 
the center flame.  Then you're teleported out.

  Sri's(S. Dwarven Isle by mountains):  Take the east passage and go as 
far north(through doors) as you can.  Turn west until you must go a few 
squares south and then go very far south.  When you defeat Sri and seem 
to be at a dead 
end go through the squares to the north/south of the bookcase.  The 
trunk with the aqua helms is to the north.

  Grey Eagle's(2):  Show Grey Eagle the feathers and he'll transport you 
to....

  Aquatic Underworld(Enolho):  Put on your aqua helms and enter.  The 
portal is in the south--drop all items except the Eternal Dagger before 
entering.  I also recommend exiting and camping and resting a lot before 
you enter the Demon World.  Even though the game says the aqua helms 
have dissolved, you can go back down safely if you leave.

  Demons' World:  Secret door to the west.  Touch the following maze 
squares:  2W of NE corner, 7W6S, 11W9S, 13W2S, 6W10S, 10S, 1W10S, 2W13S, 
and you can get to the stairs.  Go east from that room, then go east on 
the checkerboard you're teleported to.  A secret door to the 
northeast(walk through it) leads to the room that controls the portal.  
Let your player with the Dagger lead, and he can probably kill the ray 
before Anawt arrives.

  9. CHEATING

    9-1. DISK IMAGES

It's possible to "cheat" your characters up--whether you enjoy crushing 
monsters or would rather concentrate on exploring, you can improve your 
skills rapidly.  The following procedure can get stats of 250--of course, 
it's possible to improve all skills, including those your class doesn't 
normally support, but I haven't figured that out yet.  Also, be sure to back 
up your disk before byte-editing it--the wrong byte and weird things could 
happen to your characters.

For character # [a] alter bytes [b] to 0xfa(33 in  all)
(Note:  these numbers are in hexadecimal.)
1:  0x2b24-0x2b44
2:  0x2bc0-0x2be0
3:  0x2a5c-0x2a7c
4:  0x2af8-0x2aff AND 0x2900-0x2918
5:  0x2994-0x29b4
6:  0x2830-0x2850
7:  0x28cc-0x28ec
8:  0x2768-0x2788

Note that they are "in order" by 1)decreasing "hundreds" digit and 
2)increasing ones/tens digits.  That's why character 4 is split between 
hundreds digits.

    9-2. SAVE STATES

News flash: technology is wonderful. Even retro technology improves over the 
years and I'm pleased to report there's an even easier way to do this. With 
emulator save states you can edit characters directly. Of course you'll want 
to back things up too.

Each character consists of 0x9c=156 bytes. They are divided up as follows: 76 
bytes for your character, 80 for any item.

Character A starts at x5728
Character B starts at x57c4

42 2e 00 00 00 00 10 e0 = +7 reenforcing ring

Note: 36=flame 37=cold 38=storm 39=life drain
Change the first byte to give other weapons. See the items section and count 
up/down from Greatsword in order to figure the hex value.

Oh. If you want a +7 living dagger, try
0b 50 00 00 00 00 71 e5.

Fool, try an' touch me now!

  10. BUGS/INCONSISTENCIES

--Waddling Turtle calls Enolho "Enohle"
--"Electrun coins" appears in Sri's dungeon.
--The elf patrols can be seen around the temple west of Koruy--after you 
cross the desert they don't want to cross.
--You keep your gold when you cross into the demon world.  But aren't only 
living things allowed across the threshhold?
--Leaving magic on in quick mode vs. some monsters may freeze the game. Press 
"P" to start quick combat against weaker monsters.
