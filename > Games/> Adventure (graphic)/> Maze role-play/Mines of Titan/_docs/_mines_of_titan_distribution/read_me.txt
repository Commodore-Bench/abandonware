The Secret Dossier
------------------

This collection of documents SHOULD NOT BE READ UNTIL
INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY THE GAME. Originally, the documents 
were contained in a sealed envelope distributed with
the game.


Player's Guide
--------------

This is a somewhat incomplete write-up of the original
MOT documentation. Also included here is the game's
introduction, which establishes the main character's
identity and mission. 

missing sections:
   Maps and the Screen Layout
   General Options
   Tactical Combat


Visitor's Guide
---------------

Selections from the original Visitor's Guide to Titan.
The itialized comments after some sections are written
in the documentation in a hand written style font. 
Supposedly comments made by the Guide's previous owner.

missing sections:
   The Facts on Titan
   Life on Titan
   Computers and Security
   The New Frontier
   1001 Friends and Amusements
   A Strong Mind and Healthy Body

Maps
----

The original MOT documentation included maps off all
the cities and mines and caves except the lower levels
of the Proscenium mine. These are not included here.
And, honestly, they weren't very usefull anyway.


Copy Protection
---------------

The only copy protection that Mines of Titan has
occurs when attempting to learn certain abilities.
It well ask you to in some way identify an attribute
of the gun whose picture is shown. The weapon's picture
and related information are included at the end of
the Visitor's Guide.


Playing the Game
----------------

These disk images are known to work with ApplePC.
However, I found that it would except no input
unless the cycle counting option was enabled.
