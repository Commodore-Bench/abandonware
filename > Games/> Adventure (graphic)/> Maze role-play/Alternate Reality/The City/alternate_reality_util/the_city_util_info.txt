AR-City Character Disk Conversion
(for char Xfer to the Dungeon)


If you have played AR-City using deprotected copies of the
game disks (i.e. not using the original game diskettes),
then, you will probably need to convert your character Save
disk in order to transfer your character to the Dungeon.

You can do the conversion using the COPYA.AR program on
the ARC_Util.dsk.


What You Need

o- Your AR-City character Save disk

o- A diskette or, on an emulator, a .nib disk image
   to become the New Save disk (The disk does not have
   to be blank.)



Doing the Conversion

o- First, just in case something goes wrong, make a copy
   of your character Save disk.

o- Boot the ARC_Utils disk.

o- Press "I" to do a disk INIT. Put your New Save disk
   into Drive 2. Follow prompts: select Drive 2 for the
   INIT and enter 253 for the Volume Number.

o- Once the New Save disk is INITed and you are back to
   the main menu display, select (highlight) the "COPYA.AR"
   choice. Press Return to start the copy/conversion program.

o- Follow the program prompts (accept the defaults for Original
   and New Copy disks).  When the program tells you to
   insert disks, be sure ...

   Your AR-City character Save disk ("Original") is in Drive 1
   The recently INITed New Save disk ("New Copy") is in Drive 2

o- Let the program do the copy. Say No ("N") when asked if you
   want to make further copies.

o- Remove the disks and label the copy (target) something like
  "ARC New Save Disk" (or, on an emu, exit the emulator and rename
   the target .nib disk to something like "ARC_NewSave.nib").


Now, you should be able to start AR-Dungeon and transfer your
AR-City characters from your New Save disk.
