<P>It's been a good day. Reflectively, you muse that your armor and weapons
are of the highest quality, and your purse sags form the weight of many
bronze pieces. Better yet, you sit at one of the finest pubs in Infinity
with golden flagons of ale frothing in your iron grip.</P>

<P>Home and hearth, with a nagging spouse and screaming urchins? A wide
grin splits your cheeks with the knowledge that such a life will never
be yours. To the adventurous, Infinity always awaits.</P>

<P>Dragon Side II: The Twisted Speare goes beyond Bronze Dragon with ten
new adventures, a new castle maker, 200 new monsters, an interactive pub
and a miriad of surprises. DSII is completely compatible with version 3.0
of Bronze Dragon. All characters, weapons, spells, and magic items will
work just like always.</P>

<P><B>IMPORTANT</B>: Dragon Side II <U>requires</U> Bronze Dragon version
3.0.</P>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Introduction</H2>

<P>Dragon Side II is the first of many additions to the never-ending world
of Bronze Dragon (actually it was the only). It contains 10 new plots,
each lavishly designed to dazzle and perplex; 200 new monsters, with a
multitude of new ways to persecute your stalwart adventurers; and a pub
where you meet many intriguing and helpful personalities. Both the pub
and plots set a new level of sophistication for computer role-playing --
but then, you'll soon find that out yourself.</P>

<H2>The Disks</H2>

<P>Included in the Dragon Side II is one double-sided disk. In addition
to this disk you will need the <B>Bronze Side</B> and <B>Character Disk</B>
from Bronze Dragon version 3.0 and one disk you must provide, the <B>Castle
Disk</B>, just as with Bronze Dragon.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Side One: Twisted Speare</B> - This disk contains the Twisted Speare
Menu, a new Castle Maker, and the Twisted Speare Pub. This side may be
booted.</LI>

<LI><B>Side Two: Dragon Side II</B> - This side contains the monsters,
the plots, traps and treasures used to generate the castles.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>How to Go from Dragon Village to the Twisted Speare</H2>

<P>Sometimes, you may wish to go from Dragon Village to the Twisted Speare
without rebooting. Simply leave Dragon Village by hitting return. When
you are asked if you wish to return to Main Menu, insert the <B>Twisted
Speare</B> instead of the <B>Bronze Side</B>.</P>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Beginning Play</H2>

<P>Boot the <B>Twisted Speare</B> to play one of the new plots. The first
screen you'll see after the DSII logo clears is the Twisted Speare Menu.
The choices on that menu are explained below.</P>

<OL>
<H3>The Twisted Speare Menu</H3>

<LI><B>Construct a Castle</B>: This works as it does in BD (see the BD
manual), except for two important differences. The first difference is
that the levels will not always be square. The new castles are often rectangular.
Secondly, the number of rooms per level may vary slightly in a castle,
though the total number of rooms will still be correct.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Example</U>: If you ask for 20 rooms per level in a 3 level castle,
the first level might have 18 rooms, the second 23 rooms, and the third
19 rooms. However, the total number of areas will still be 60.<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Gather Party</B>: Before entering the Twisted Speare, you must gather
your party together (see the BD manual).<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Enter the Twisted Speare</B>: You must have your party gathered
for the appropriate plot before entering the Twisted Speare. The new pub
is explained later, in its own section.<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Go on an Adventure</B>: After you've talked in the Twisted Speare,
this will take your party to one of the new castles.<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Return to Main Menu</B>: This takes you to the Main Menu on the
<B>Bronze Side</B>, from which you can visit King Leopold, Enter Dragon
Village, or whatever else your heart desires.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">The Twisted Speare</H2>

<P>Before entering the Twisted Speare, you must gather your party for the
plot you wish to talk about. The Speare is an interactive pub - you can
choose topics and people to converse with, and even show them objects to
see if they recognize them. Sometimes, you won't even know about a topic
until someone casually mentions it! People may come and go for their own
reasons while you're in the pub. Some may even want to buy or trade objects
with you. You should always visit the pub before going on an adventure.</P>

<H3>How to Operate the Twisted Speare</H3>

<P>After the opening description, use the arrow or number keys to move
amongst the patrons. To choose one to speak with, hit RETURN.</P>

<P>Use the same procedure to pick a topic. After picking a topic, the person
will say something to you. You can continue by asking that person about
a different topic. When you're through talking, use the Space Bar to toggle
back to the patrons and choose someone new.</P>

<P>The patrons will often tell you about plot objects if they're shown
the objects. To do so, put the proper object in hand with the Inventory
command then choose the Object in Hand topic.</P>

<H4>Pub Commands</H4>

<P><B>S - Spokesman</B>: This allows a different party member to ask questions
or show their own objects. The current spokesman is highlighted on the
left.</P>

<P><B>I - Inventory</B>: The spokesman can put something new in hand. If
you want to ask Falstaff about a blue orb, you need to use Inventory to
put the orb in hand. The object in hand will be highlighted on the right.</P>

<P><B>P - Print</B>: If you have a printer card in slot one you can print
your conversations on hardcopy. Hit &quot;P&quot; when you wish to begin
printing and hit it again to stop.</P>

<P><B>L - Leave</B>: After you have finished talking, hit &quot;L&quot;
to leave the pub.</P>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Background Information</H2>

<H3>The Twisted Speare</H3>

<P>You should visit the pub often, at least once before every adventure.
Not only do the pub patrons give good hints, but they often play a vital
role in the solution itself. The patrons often know how to use a plot object
if you bring it along and show it to them.</P>

<P>If you haven't already guessed, almost all of the characters and just
a few of the events in the pub are based on Shakespeare's work - though
twisted. Most of it comes from Richard II, Henry IV parts 1 and 2, and
Henry V. Of course, you needn't be familiar with the immortal bard to play
these plots. Just consider it added flavoring.</P>

<H3>The Castle Maker</H3>

<P>Dragon Side II contains 200 new monsters, from the simple first level
baddies to the complex high level terrors. Be careful when assigning the
difficulty rating for the new castles, as the new ratings are more differentiated
(Difficulty 6 is significantly tougher than 5, etc.).</P>

<P>Also note that you cannot input 10 as a &quot;starting monster level.&quot;
This level contains the likes of Thor, Asmodeus, Mephistopheles, Ra, Odin
et al. To get to these god-like creatures, start with level 9 and choose
a high difficulty.</P>

<H3>The World</H3>

<P>The world of Infinity serves as the backdrop to nearly all adventures
in Bronze Dragon. Medalia is one of the major continents on Infinity and
is composed of several &quot;rival kingdoms.&quot; Dragon Village (which
is actually a small city) is in the middle of the small kingdom of Hinterland,
ruled by King Leopold VI. His title is disputed by the so-called Lord Usul
of the Shadowlands, but that's another story.... Neighboring Hinterland
to the southeast is the Far Wind valleys, ruled by King Miegra. The Twisted
Speare is a pub in the border town of Stratford on the edge of Saxony,
ruled by King Henry IV. This is where the adventures of Dragon Side II
take place.</P>

<H3>The Plots</H3>

<P>Read the following sections on the plots before you play them.</P>

<H4>Plot 1: A Thief in the Night</H4>

<P>Hassan Chop, a master level thief of guild 106, sneaked into the local
guild 147 a few weeks ago and stole the Tome of Larceny without the approval
of his supperiors. His deed put both guilds in an awkward position. Guild
147 could not retaliate without risking a costly intraguild war. For guild
106, returning any rightfully stolen item would be an unacceptable breach
of the &quot;code.&quot; Guildmaster Peto of 147 sees you as a solution
for the problem and awaits you at the Twisted Speare.</P>

<H4>Plot 2: Beyond the Spectrum</H4>

<P>It began so simply. Tum Ak Lar and his band of heroes were attacking
the fortress of Aquiem. They penetrated its outer defenses quickly and
were battling their way through the courtyard when it happened. Accounts
vary, but some facts are certain.</P>

<P>Four spectral cubes guarded the courtyard door to the inner chamber.
Tum killed one, a cube blasted Adrian to foil his leap, and Lovli and Forcon
both missed. The wizard Quislan had an idea: to teleport a cube away with
a dimension door spell. Just as he cast it, the spectral cube began to
turn white....</P>

<P>No one knows why, but the resulting explosion killed every member of
the party and the cubes, save the one the spell was cast upon. It solidified
into color-streaked stone, and began to grow until it reached its present
form, a very odd castle.</P>

<H4>Plot 3: Ruins of the Kaokanti</H4>

<P>An old (some say the oldest) civilization has been rediscovered recently.
All history of the race had been lost, except for a few records and of
course, the famous Kaokantian songbirds. Yours is a mission of reconnaissance
and recovery.</P>

<H4>Plot 4: The Fallen Star Expedition</H4>

<P>Three weeks ago, you saw a star shoot across the sky and crash some
distance away. With painstaking research, you've found that it landed somewhere
in the grasslands. Mayhap someone in the pub will know more.</P>

<H4>Plot 5: Path of a Minotaur</H4>

<P>After days of thought, you've finally found a quest worthy of its walking
distance. The legend of the Great Minotaur swirls equal parts of fear,
apprehension, and excitement in the pit of your stomach. This much you
know - he lives in a great labyrinth that no one, no matter how carefully
they mapped, could negotiate. There must be some other answer.</P>

<H4>Plot 6: Castle of Dreams</H4>

<P>Bagging a demon named Barantis in a castle that may or may not exist
sounds like your line of work. Except, if your information is correct,
this particular monster is far too powerful to defeat in ordinary combat.
On the other hand, your prestige (and money) will increase considerably
if you manage to defeat an Arch-demon.</P>

<P>(You must save an object in order to solve plot 7).</P>

<H4>Plot 7: Dragon in a Wizard's Eye</H4>

<P>From what you hear, a gateway to an alternate universe exists within
the Mountain of Wizard's Art. Though the rumor mongers also claim that
the alternate universe is decidedly odd, the thought of fantastic undiscovered
treasure once again weighs like a lodestone on your greedy mind.</P>

<H4>Plot 8: Seven Sinister Sapphires</H4>

<P>Exactly how the fabled Seven Sinister Sapphires turned up in Midlands
University is a mystery you may never unravel. Ah, well, so long as you
get the precious baubles, who really cares how they got there?</P>

<H4>Plot 9: The Forever Realm</H4>

<P>A raven spiraled down from darkened clouds and delivered a note bearing
the seal of King Henry. It read as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P>Your magnificent deeds of valor have reached the ears of the Great Wizard
Glendower. I have a rather unique task in store for you: Go to the Castle
Entropy and complete my spell of destruction. By now you must be aware
of the situation which detains me else I would accomplish this simple mission
post haste. If you have further need of my knowledge, I will be awaiting
you amid the peasants of the Twisted Speare.</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><P>The Royal Master Wizard</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Owen Glendower</P></CENTER>

<P><B>IMPORTANT</B>: The Get Rid of option under Inventory has been replaced
with Drop Object. As you might guess, dropping an object simply puts an
object of your choice on the floor so you could pick it up later.</P>

<H4>Plot 10: Murder Royale</H4>

<P>Duke Angelo, the Royal Inquisitor, has asked for your assistance in
the investigation of a murder. The victim must be pretty important to come
under the jurisdiction of Angelo. With this in mind you make your way to
the Twisted Speare, where the suspects are gathered. It is left to you
to acquire the evidence in the Castle of the Seasons, question the suspects,
and solve the murder.</P>

<P><B>IMPORTANT</B>: You must enter the Twisted Speare, present the right
evidence, question the right suspects, and accuse the guilty to solve the
murder. When you have presented enough incriminating evidence, use the
Accuse command and answer the questions. After presenting your case, you
will be given the results of your investigation. If you are incorrect,
you must start again, presenting your case from the beginning.</P>
