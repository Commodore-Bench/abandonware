Armed withheat-seeking lasers and touch-controlled flight mechanism, Thexder is theultimate fighting machine.  There is only one Thexder in existence, and youare the proud pilot at its control.  Be careful.  If disaster falls upon yourvehicle, there will be no replacements, and your mission will be terminated.>> Score <<        Your score will increase with each creature you destroy, depending onthe type of creature.  You do not get extra points for completing a level, butyou do get an increase in your enmax and energy points (depending on whetheryou used your shield).  See Below.>> Energy Increases <<        1.  When you destroy certain creatures.  How many energy-releasing            creatures can you discover?        2.  When you complete a level without using your shield (energy            increases by 100 points [up to enmax]).>> Energy Decreases <<        1.  When you make contact with any of the enemy creatures.        2.  When you make contact with any hazardous area (lava pits, acid            lakes, etc.).        3.  When you fire your lasers.  Energy loss = 2 points for every 30            shots taken.        4.  When you lock on shields.  Energy loss = 10 points for each use of            a shield.>> Enmax Increases <<        1.  When you destroy certain enemy creatures.  How many enmax-bearing            creatures can you discover?        2.  When you finish each level:  Level completed = 10 enmax points.            Level completed without using shields = additional 20 enmax points.       Enmax never decreases.  Maximum enmax allowed in game = 500 points.>> Additional Tips <<        1.  Make maps of each world.  Map out the exits as you through each            level.  Take note of the booby traps and hidden creatures.  Follow            the most accessible and least dangerous psth to the next exit.        2.  Try to build up your enmax capicity whenever possible.  This is the            key ingredient to your prolonged existence.  Find the creatures            that will boost enmax.  Refrain from using your shields for addit-            ional enmax bonuses.  See ENMAX INCREASES.        3.  Use your shields sparingly.  Remember--You receive bonus points if            you can survive a level without activating the shield.  Also, you            do not receive energy points for eliminating creatures while your            shield is activated.        4.  Don't shoot at everything.  Avoid the creatures which provide no            energy or enmax increases.  Only eliminate the creatures that will            benifit Thexder.>> How To Play <<        When the game opens, you are the pilot of a Thexder Super AssaultVehicle.  You have been locked into the facility with no means of escape.  Youare currently in the Thexder Robot mode.  Your only direction to travel is tothe right.  There are 16 different worlds to explore.  The challenge:  How farcan you go?>> Goal <<        To survive all 16 levels and destroy the evil creatures which dwell inthis forbidden world.>> The Forbidden World <<        Here lies a land shrouded in mystery, with 16 different regions to ex-plore.  From underground caverns to vast cargo holds, you will constantly en-counter strange and dangerous beings and bone-chilling environments.  BEWARE!!Danger lurks around every corner!>> The Status Screen <<        The status screen on your computer is the only tool you have availableto keep track of your energy level, the level of the world you occupy, and yourscore.  Learn to use this iinformation wisely.  It will help you determine whento fight and when to flee.                             Up                ______________________________               |         |         |          |               |    Y    |    U    |     I    |               |_________|_________|__________|               |         |         |          |        Left   |    H    |    J    |     K    |   Right               |_________|___Stop__|__________|               |         |         |     Transform |    N    |    M    |               |_________|_________|                            DownDirection Keys:K          RightJ          StopH          LeftU          Jump UpY          Jump Up LeftI          Jump Up RightN          TransformM          Down Right[ or ]     Toggles SpeedIIe/IIc:Open Apple     FireClosed Apple   Shield ToggleCTRL-S         Toggle SoundIIc+:Open Apple     FireOPTION key     Shield ToggleCTRL-S         Toggle SoundJoystick is automatically selected if plugged in.
